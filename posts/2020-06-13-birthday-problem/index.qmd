We have all been there, classic math riddle:

> How many people need to be in one room so that the probability of two of them having the same birthday is more than 0.5?

In a recent bootcamp exercise we tackled this in python and I wanted to share, just because it's fun. I did it for a range of probabilities. My solution is probably not the fastest/shortest/most pythonic, but it's a little thing I put out there so, if you want to use/improve it, please do!


```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


def prob(n):
	numerator = np.math.factorial(365) / np.math.factorial(365-n)
	denominator = 365 ** n
	return(1 - numerator/denominator)

probs = list(map(prob, range(100)))

plt.plot(range(len(probs)), probs)
plt.show()
```


A bad translation into R, it would be something like:

```{r}
#| echo: true
prob <- function(n){
  numerator = exp(lfactorial(365) - lfactorial(365-n))
	denominator = 365 ** n
	return(1 - numerator/denominator)
}

probs = sapply(0:99, function(n) prob(n))

plot(0:99, probs, type="l",
     main="Probability of 2 people having same birthday",
     xlab = "People in a room", ylab="probability")
```
