Yes, the plague killed the Western world, but that's not what this book is about. The first chapter is an invitation to think outside of what you know Humanity did, just to be shown that Humanity would be Humanity again: the good, the bad, and the ugly. <br/><br/>Most importantly, this book is a fantastic tour throughout human nature, narrated through the lens of 3 archetypical humans:<br/><br/>K: The lider, the motivational engine, the aggressive, the revolutionary, the critic, the one who defies Death for breakfast. <br/>I: The intellectual, often consumed by the pursuit of knowledge. The one who sets course. The wise one, the inquisitive one. Often weak, sometimes slow to act.<br/>B: The people person, the broker, the faithful one. The open one, the hungry one, demanding to be guided and be given purpose. The learner.<br/><br/>Defiant of any genre convention, there are minimal changes in the arc the characters go through. The meat and potatoes resides in the interaction between characters and how well each gets to fulfill their fate because of that. What's more, if there's any progress for them (and Humanity), it's because of minutia in the way they interact. It's because of all that is forgotten but actually happens during the years of rice and salt. <br/><br/>Robinson writes with the characteristic style of creating a world anew, which will entertain you for pages. Then, the author will stab you with a truth poisoned dagger when you least expected it. You thought this or that character were plain or boring? Stabbed again.<br/><br/>That said, since Robinson writes extremely long and convoluted pieces, with an alchemic approach that smashes fiction and non-fiction altogether into its own genre. In other words, this author is not for everyone. You need to have a taste for non-fiction and enough patience to, as a non-fiction reader, ""put up"" with the narrative devices that fiction demands. If you are a fiction reader, you have to ""put up"" with little to no fiction, with characters that will blast into an opinionated narrator's monologue for 10 pages at a time, and a degree of meta that might put you off. The good news about this book being split in the way it is, is that you can skip ahead if one particular chapter is rubbing you the wrong way. The characters will be reborn in the next one in more interesting situations and you get to be reborn with them.",,,1,0

James Clear wanted to read a lot of books and make a summary of the concepts he would implement for self-improvement. He also made a point in improve himself in the most hacky way possible. Instead of keeping the summary as personal notes, he published it. The fact that the author boasts about being a writer only makes it worse. You can actually smell the cheap tools he uses to put words into text and build chapters out of thin air. I wanted this book to get better, but it doesn't, up to the very end the author repeats the same choice pattern:<br/><br/>* Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them.<br/>* Simplify science to the border of being wrong.  <br/>* Abuse of ""as such person said ___INSERT QUOTE HERE____""<br/>* Build each chapter out of unacknowledged (stolen/refurbished) concepts, coming from other writings that predate this book.<br/><br/>The last point is particularly annoying and the book is plagued by them. He even uses the same graphics and plots as the originals! He includes verbatim whole poems by Lao Tse or writings by Seneca.  At least these are attributed and not refurbished. <br/>If you are somewhat familiar with the literature, avoid this book.<br/>If you are thinking about reading this book, think about the books the author got the content from. Go and read those, you will get the original content without the coarse editing by James Clear.  You will also get better foundations for growing a mindset instead of implementing hacks.<br/><br/>Start with Why - Simon Sinek<br/>Mastery - George Leonard<br/>Outliers - Malcom Gladwell<br/>The Tipping Point - Malcom Gladwell<br/>Getting Things Done - David Allen<br/>The Element - Ken Robinson<br/>Behave - Robert Sapolsky [Science communication written by experts in the field]<br/>Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman [Science communication written by experts in the field]<br/>",,,1,0
