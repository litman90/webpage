<p>It’s been a bit more than a year since I got a fitbit and I have been pretty excited about tracking my activity and heart rate. I should say I’m quite surprised about the sleep data. Tracking sleep has been, in fact, the most exciting feature, and I now strive to get at least 7 hours of sleep per night.</p>
<p>Let’s first see a glimpse of the data, just to know what type of data we are dealing with.</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_449d71aadc60365c95379d226147e553">

<p>Let’s now inspect the overall distribution for heart rate and step values.</p>

<p>I will start by focusing on the data for steps.</p>
<p>I’m curious to see what times of the day have the most activity. Because I have a quite large amount of data points (~751 K) I will use <code>geom_hex()</code> to count for me and simplify rendering<sup>1</sup>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Well, I should have remembered that for the vast majority of minutes (regardless of the hour of the day), the count is exactly zero. Let’s only look at the positive counts:</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We see now some patches that have high activity (&gt; 100 steps), particularly around 9:00, 12:00 and 18:00. These mostly correspond to “going to work”, “activity around lunch time (?)”, and “going home / physical activity”. For all other cases, it looks like I move around 10-20 steps per minute, regardless of the minute within the hour.</p>
<section id="last-10-minutes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="last-10-minutes">Last 10 minutes</h3>
<p>The result above is interesting because I usually have to be reminded by Fitbit to “move up to 250 steps in the hour”. I receive this notification during the last 10 minutes of the hour and I would think that during those 10 minutes I put more steps than during the first 50. The data show I’m wrong:</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>That being said, I want to keep my reminder on. I feel like having it turned on definitely adds ~ 1000-2000 steps per day.</p>
</section>
<section id="daily-average" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="daily-average">Daily average</h3>
<p>Let’s get one level above and aggregate each day as a unit. This plot shows a nice trend, with months from May to August showing an increase on the number of steps. Keep in mind that November will show little average steps because for that month we have incomplete data (last day in database is 2019-11-13),</p>

<p>At this part of the analysis, I should make clear that I took vacations from <code>2019-06-27</code> to <code>2019-07-11</code>. We will use this information in the analysis to make some things clear.</p>

</section>
<section id="distribution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="distribution">Distribution</h2>
<p>We looked at the average daily steps for each month, how about the distribution of daily steps? We see that most days I come quite close to the default target of 10K steps. There are some days with very little steps (see below) and, obviously, some days with extreme number of steps.</p>

<section id="extreme-events" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extreme-events">Extreme events</h2>
<p>Using the boxplot below, we can define <em>extreme events</em> as instances where I walked more than 20K steps. I chose to plot this by day of the week, to get an insight about periodicity of events.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Because I walked a lot during the vacations, I highlighted the days on top of the previous boxplot. Most of the extreme events are definitely during the vacations. Moreover, none of the days I walked less than 10K steps, pretty amazing!</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are some extreme <em>low</em> events, these are quite likely the days I just don’t wear the fitbit (or days I forget to wear it for most of the day). Just because I can order the data and make another plot, I went ahead and did it!</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We usually go for walks on Saturdays and/or Sundays. Knowing this little piece of data, it’s quite expected to see Saturdays being the days with higher number of steps (and hence higher success rate on the 10K target).</p>

<p>I want to turn the focus now to the seasonality of the data. I will use a helper function <code>getSeason()</code> that I took from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9500114/find-which-season-a-particular-date-belongs-to">StackOverflow</a>.</p>
<p>We can inspect the effect of season on my walking.</p>

<section id="a-years-heart-rate-in-one-plot" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-years-heart-rate-in-one-plot">A year’s heart rate in one plot</h2>
<p>I’m borrowing <strong>heavily</strong> from <a href="https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/12/27/a-year-as-told-by-fitbit/">Nick</a> here. But I thought it was a brilliant plot, so I took it for a ride with my data. I actually changed a few things, I decided to keep the native sampling rate and use <code>geom_line()</code> instead of down-sampling and using <code>geom_tile()</code>. The overall trend is clear, movements during the morning and the afternoon that correlate well with going and coming back from work. Somewhere around July 2019 you can see the change in timezone when I took vacations. There are a couple of days in late May with continuously high or lacking values, I take this as one of the days I forgot the fitbit at home, likely spurious measures.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>I have been thinking about different problems I have when writing code and the things that I normally try to do to keep my projects clean and functional. I wrote this post to put this thoughts out there, hopefully I will receive input from the great software engineers.</p>
<section id="problems-in-mind" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problems-in-mind">Problems in mind</h2>
<section id="where-do-you-live" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-do-you-live">Where do you live?</h3>
<p>Code files usually live in one folder, which is also a GitHub folder that you and your team commit/push to. So far, so good. But what do you do with the data to feed that monster pipeline of yours?</p>
<p>I will assume that your concerns with data privacy are minor or you handled them accordingly (only private parties have access to the data).</p>
<p>Now, you still have the problem of <em>where</em> to put this other folder, which is basically a size problem.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Small files can live with your data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the case for small and few text files of some thousand rows. Easy enough, you just go with your <code>/repo-name/data/</code> and live happily ever after.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Medium size files</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These files are big enough to be a problem for hosting on GitHub. File formats start to be an issue here, images and video will not be easily accessible anywhere you take it.</p>
<p><strong>Options: the cloud</strong> ☁️</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> It’s fluffy. Now, seriously, it’s good that your code can point to one place, download the stuff into local and use it. Every computer can do the same and there <em>should</em> be no problem. Because your sizes are not huge, you <em>should</em> be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> You need internet. No, internet it’s not everywhere all the time<sup>1</sup>. Internet is not in my cellphone on a second basement in a concrete building. Even with the fastest internet, it’s not trivial to setup <code>your-favorite-cloud-service</code> to allow access to <code>the-sketchy-script-you-wrote</code><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://matiasandina.netlify.app/posts/2019-11-14-on-pipelines/simple_credentials.jpg" class="img-fluid">
</center>
<hr>
<p><strong>Options: Good old-fashioned external hard drive.</strong> 💾</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> This is a good one if your data size is in the Gb range and you don’t really need to share it with too many people.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Hard drives fail. Are you ready to lose your data? It starts to get really annoying when you have to do back-ups of your data and your data is big enough that you can’t use your computer’s hard drive (that’s why you chose an external hard drive in the first place). Should you have an external hard drive for the external hard drive? Are you planning to write the output of your code on those hard drives? Brace for impact.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://matiasandina.netlify.app/posts/2019-11-14-on-pipelines/spiderman_pointing_meme.jpg" class="img-fluid">
</center>
<p>External hard-drives might have paths that change depending on which computer is connected to. This can easily be a path inferno. Moreover, some hard drives don’t work if you try to use them in different OS.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Large sizes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I work with brains. Last time I checked, one mouse brain is <code>~2TB</code>, n=1, just a few channels, not even the best resolution we can get.</p>
<p>I think local/cloud servers are the only way to go here<sup>3</sup>. I don’t have a lot of experience with this, but I have suffered internet upload/download speed problems when I try to sync with my cloud back-ups or share image/video files with my team.</p>
</section>
<section id="paths-need-to-be-absolute" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paths-need-to-be-absolute">Paths need to be absolute</h3>
<p>Because your working directory is the folder where your code lives<sup>4</sup>, but your data folder lives elsewhere, you kind of need to use absolute paths all the time.</p>
<p>I have only been able to fix this issue using functions that attempt to fix this when running the script.</p>

<span id="cb1-7">                       local_path)</span>
<span id="cb1-8">}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is particularly annoying when you have to run commands that involve calling things from console.</p>
<p>Let’s call <code>ImageJ</code> from R.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

<span id="cb2-2">             macro_to_run))</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The moment somebody changes the Fiji folder, or tries to call ImageJ from another computer, that code brakes. I’m unaware of how to make sure these things bullet-proof, <strong>please enlighten me</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s call <code>python</code> from R. Wait, what version of python do you want? I rest my case.</p>
</section>
<section id="processes-are-identified-by-the-files" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="processes-are-identified-by-the-files">Processes are identified by the files</h3>
<p>I have this problem quite often. It might be because my pipelines follow this logic.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<div class="DiagrammeR html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item" id="htmlwidget-829cf29291305b9bdd78" style="width:100%;height:464px;"></div>

</div>
<p>It’s quite difficult to escape the infinite <code>list all files</code> –&gt; <code>apply function to all files</code> –&gt; <code>write computations into new files</code> loop. I don’t really know what’s on the other side.</p>
<p>The main problem is that your previous, current, and next files always serve as identifiers and you need to carry over their absolute path (to be able to read them form your data folder). Whenever these paths get corrupted (or you change your computer) things stop working.</p>
<p>This problem might stem from the fact that I normally have to process experimental units through the pipeline. I have to do many things to an experimental unit and have many many experimental units composing the data for one pipeline. That’s when my inner voice goes:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But I would also like to have the possibility to run or re-run just one (or just a few experimental units).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way I handle this is by leaving open the door to hand selection of files (aka interactive mode, not fun). However, interactive mode somewhat helps with the problem below.</p>
</section>
<section id="dont-move-my-files" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dont-move-my-files">Don’t move my files</h3>
<p>People do stuff people normally do, like moving folders around…that’s BAD, REALLY BAD. It’s also quite difficult to communicate the need to keep the file structure without casting the magic spells of <em>everything will break</em><sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>I don’t feel good with the level of dependency on file structure that my projects always end up having. <strong>Please enlighten me on this one too!</strong></p>

<section id="dont-rename-my-files" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dont-rename-my-files">Don’t rename my files</h3>
<p>Don’t rename my files, except when I do. That would be a better subtitle of this section. A great way of not dealing with multiple copies of the same files. For example, let’s say you applied a mask to an image and then cropped, and rotated it. How many files do you keep? What if your image size was 1 Gb?</p>
<p>My hack around this is to rename the files (this include the cases where I just want to move files to specific sub-folders). Because I rely so much on the file names, this renaming usually comes back to bite me. I just 🤷.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="operating-systems">Operating systems</h3>
<p>I’m writing this in 2019, I thought the OS problem was solved. Turns out it’s not solved at all and developers shy away from it more often than they should. I understand them, developing for every OS is a huge pain and requires you to constantly check in multiple machines (or have access to a teammate that breaks your code as soon as you push it).</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>I have been lucky to participate in the project lead by Sarah McAnulty called <a href="https://www.skypeascientist.com">Skype a scientist</a>. I recently did two more calls with 11th grade students who attend Dowal school in Honduras. This was the first time I did Skype a Scientist in Spanish!</p>
<p>As usual, I should say it was great to be able to talk with students, tell them about science in general and my research. It was really fun to answer their questions.</p>
<p>I compiled the Q&amp;A session below.</p>
<section id="personal-questions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personal-questions">Personal questions</h2>
<p>The “how did you choose to be a neuroscientist” question was quite popular. It came in all these forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did your professional career begin?</li>
<li>What was your motivation for studying this career?</li>
<li>What made you decide you wanted to be a neuroscientist?</li>
<li>What was your inspiration to study that exact part of the body? Why not other?</li>
<li>How did you decide Neuroscience was your passion? And what things made you decide this career?</li>
<li>What inspired you to choose this career?</li>
<li>What led you to study this career?</li>
<li>When did you start to have an interest in this career and why?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer is:</p>
<p>I just felt really curious about how the natural world works. I could see beauty in Math and later in Chemistry, and wanted to learn more. Living things are <em>by far</em> the most complex systems we know of, so I was totally down for the challenge of figuring out how they work.</p>
<p><strong>How many years did you study?</strong></p>
<p>I can tell you how many years I’ve been in school. Elementary school was 7, middle/high-school was 5, then university added another 5-6 years, 2 years for my Master’s of Science degree. School is just the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>How young where you when you decided to study your major?</strong></p>
<p>I was 17. In Argentina you chose your “major” in the last year of high school. I chose Biology. Then, 3 years into the career, I chose neuroscience specifically (I was probably 21-22), to specialize in for 2-3 more years.</p>
<p><strong>What would you have studied if it was not neuroscience?</strong> // <strong>What do you think would have been of yourself if you had studied something else?</strong></p>
<p>Probably Chemistry or Engineering. If I could go back in time, I would tell myself to study Physics or Computer Science.</p>
<p><strong>Was neuroscience always your passion, or did you want to study something else?</strong></p>
<p>I started with biology but rather quickly wanted to study the brain specifically.</p>
<p><strong>What ability do you think separates humans from other animal species?</strong></p>
<p>So far that we know, humans are aware (see below) and can communicate that quite clearly. Humans can also build upon knowledge of previous generations.</p>
<p><strong>What is the hardest topic or part to understand about Neuroscience?</strong></p>
<p>Neuroscience is full of hard, really hard, problems. I would have to say the most difficult is consciousness. How are we aware of being aware? How is it that we distinguish ourselves as an <em>I</em> that exists and has a <em>will</em>? Where is <em>that voice in your head</em> coming from? I wrote a short story about it, I might publish it some day :).</p>
<p><strong>What is the part that isn’t too important of the brain?</strong></p>
<p>I would have to say that you need 100% of your brain to function the way you do. I am not quite eager of losing any part of my brain, all of them are too important.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between brain neurons and normal neurons?</strong></p>
<p>I am a bit confused about the term <em>normal</em> neurons. There are neurons in the brain, neurons in the spinal cord and in our digestive tract. The basic principles of all neurons are the same, but, even in the brain, they differ in shape and physiological properties. Here’s a drawing from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Ramón_y_Cajal">Cajal</a> showing different neurons in the human cortex.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Cajal_cortex_drawings.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Does your family feel good with what are you studying or they wanted you to study another thing?</strong></p>
<p>My family was always supportive. As usual, a career in science looks difficult and it might seem like it’s quite tough to get a job, so there were some doubts, but nonetheless my family was supportive.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we sometimes forget the words we were going to say at the time?</strong></p>
<p>This is a <em>great</em> question. I don’t have a clue! Please, if you find out, let me know!</p>
<p><strong>Why is your research important?</strong></p>
<p>It’s quite difficult to pinpoint why <em>any</em> experiment is important. But we can think about knowledge as a circle, and questions as a frontier to the outside (the <em>unknown</em>). The more we study and answer questions, the more the circle grows. The larger the circle, the more things the scientific field can improve our lives. Interestingly, the more the circle grows, the larger the frontier, meaning we have more questions to answer<sup>1</sup>!</p>
<p><strong>Have you learned any lesson from your years of work that you can apply in your daily life?</strong> // <strong>Does this job affect your personal life in any way?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, see below.</p>
<p><strong>What event in your life as a neuroscientist marked you in your personal life and why?</strong></p>
<p>Being a scientist involves dealing with information about the world. A fact is a fact. Now, there are different ways of making sense of that fact, and the way scientists do it is by building models (creating a hypothesis) and making predictions. Scientists should always start by trying to prove themselves wrong. Only when they failed to prove themselves wrong, they tend to accept a version of the world (the one that better fits that fact).</p>
<p>Presented with an observation people tend to go with intuitive explanations of why it happened. Normally, that intuitive is close to whatever that person has at hand, whatever personal experience they have (we call this reasoning by induction, which is quite useful and intuitive, but often fails). Scientific training should aim to teach to think in counterintuitive ways.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Cygnus_olor_2_%28Marek_Szczepanek%29.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>White swan (<em>Cygnus olor</em>)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Observation 1: I see a white swan.<br>
Observation 2: I have never seen a black swan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is tempting to conclude that black swans do not exist. And the whole world thought that way until they went to Australia and New Zeland and found a black one!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Black_swan_jan09.jpg/1280px-Black_swan_jan09.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Black swan (<em>Cygnus atratus</em>)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The bottom line is, being a scientist teaches you to approach facts by questioning your intuition and making testable arguments. Do not belive whatever is writen, no mater where it is writen, judge the content, hold it to the highest standard.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that later on, when neuroscience is more advanced, there could exist the cure to neurological diseases?</strong></p>
<p>When nuroscience advances more, we will find more cures or treatments. There will be no <em>unique</em> cure, because there is no <em>unique</em> neurological disease.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it that when you read the words that describe an experience, you can sometimes, perfectly imagine the situation?</strong></p>
<p>That is a <em>great</em> question. I was recently discussing this with other neuroscientists. The truth is that we do not know. But our mind is perfectly capable of creating images (when you sleep yo can <em>see</em> even though your eyes are closed!). The mind is quite powerful at doing this. Try the following task. If you want to be scientific about it, you can time yourself!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Trial 1: As fast as you can, read out loud the word sequence.<br>
Trial 2: As fast as you can, name out loud the color.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<div>
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://matiasandina.netlify.app/posts/2019-09-13-skype-a-scientist-2/index_files/figure-html/stroop-1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="672"></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>What task was more difficult? You can see how powerful the interference of reading is. It’s quite difficult to name the color when the word clearly says another thing! This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect">Stroop Effect</a></p>
<p><strong>What was the most difficult subject while studying to become a neuroscientist?</strong></p>
<p>Physics has some concepts that are difficult to grasp like Optics, Thermodynamics and Electromagnetism.</p>
<p><strong>How are memories stored and retrieved?</strong></p>
<p>That’s one of the best questions I ever had. Actually, that was one of the questions that lead me to study neuroscience in the first place. Although there are certain hypothesis, we know little about how it is done. You can start <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/steve_ramirez_and_xu_liu_a_mouse_a_laser_beam_a_manipulated_memory">here</a>. If you want to know more scientific detail, hit me up and I will send you a bunch of papers :)</p>
<p><strong>Are you happy or satisfied with what you’ve attained in your life so far?</strong></p>
<p>Wow this is getting to the hard stuff! I would say I have come a long way but there’s definitely room for improvement and new challenges to tackle.</p>
<p><strong>What goals are you looking forward to achieve in your career as a neuroscientist?</strong></p>
<p>I would like to be able to keep doing research in science. Hopefully be able to contribute to a better understanding of disase and treatment.</p>
<p><strong>What is the most difficult part of being a neuroscientist?</strong> // <strong>What is the hardest part of your carreer?</strong></p>
<p>Dealing with failure. We must be perseverant and smart about pivoting directions when we fail.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have seen something that does not have any explication about animal behavior?</strong> // <strong>Have you ever had a situation in which you don’t know the solution to in your career?</strong></p>
<p>Every day, all day, all the time! No, seriously, we need help trying to figure animal behavior, please come help us!</p>
<p><strong>What’s your biggest inspiration to do science?</strong> // <strong>What is the thing you like most about it?</strong></p>
<p>It’s beautiful. The feeling of understanding something deep about our Universe is quite rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>How did studying in MIT help develop more your career?</strong></p>
<p>I got to work with nice people and do a bunch of cool science. That will get the research published (hopefully soon!) and it will allow me to continue my career as a scientist.</p>
<p><strong>What tips can you give for those people that what to study neuroscience?</strong></p>
<p>Perseverance, we all fail, push forward. Find a team and contribute to that team with the best you can. Other people have given better advice than me <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html">here</a>. It’s long but I highly recommend it.</p>
<p><strong>Would you consider the outdoor activities you practice important for any scientific or personal development?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, running, playing sports, dancing, and any outdoor/physical activities are crucial to physical well-being and mental health.</p>
<p><strong>How can animals feel pain?</strong></p>
<p>We animals have pain receptors that comunicate the sensation of pain. See more info <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociceptor">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Structure_of_sensory_system_%284_models%29_E.PNG/375px-Structure_of_sensory_system_%284_models%29_E.PNG" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>What is the process you most use when researching animal behavior?</strong></p>
<p>I would say looking at the animals with my eyes. Everything else is a way to quantify and modify the intuition I get from looking at the animals.</p>
<p><strong>Do animals can have the same diseases as humans?</strong></p>
<p>Some diseases affect all animals, some diseases affect some animals, some are human-specific (for example HIV - AIDS).</p>
<p><strong>Does this work involve more physiology or biochemistry?</strong></p>
<p>It involves everything. Everything you learn can be useful (even if it’s not scientific <em>per se</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain the difference between MRI and CT scans?</strong></p>
<p>Both techniques can be used to image tissue. The main difference is that one uses X-rays (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan">CT scan</a>) and the other uses magnetic fields and radiowaves to do it (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging">MRI</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What would happen if a kid is born without a developed central nervous system and how you will solve it?</strong></p>
<p>It probably depends on the type of underdevelopment. Unfortunately, I would not be able to solve it (I do not work with clinical patients, I work with animals in basic research).</p>
<p><strong>What is the behavior of cockroaches after being irriated with co-60?</strong></p>
<p>I have no idea. After googling co-60, that is cobalt 60, I found out it is actually a radioactive form of cobalt. My question is: <strong>how much</strong> co-60 are we talking about? Anyway, that experiment has been done, in a paper called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aesa/56.3.256">Some Early Effects of Ionizing Radiation on the German Cockroach,Blattella germanica</a>. Authors concluded that radiation destroys reproductive organs and produces death. I don’t think behavior was affected but definitely lifespan was.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever been scared of working with a specific animal?</strong> // <strong>Is it complicated being Neuroscientist and interacting with a certain species?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, working with animals is a little bit challenging. Rodents are, in general, much easier to work with than other animals. Some animals are more scary to work with (owls, bats, monkeys, pigs). Wild animals are probably really hard to work with.</p>
<p><strong>What made you interact with animals instead of humans?</strong> // <strong>Why did you wanted to study animal behavior instead of human behavior?</strong> // <strong>Why did you choose to be a neuroscientist that focused on animals?</strong></p>
<p>I’m most interested in interventions. We can’t open human brains to see what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>How difficult and compromising is to choose neuroscience as a future career?</strong></p>
<p>It definitely involves commitment. And commitment alone will not get you very far. You can be very committed and still not get good things out of it. Do not underestimate your network and pure luck!</p>
<p><strong>How has working with animals improved your knowledge about human behavior?</strong></p>
<p>It has given me the possibility to test ideas about human behavior on animal models.</p>
<p><strong>What has been the most difficult species of animal that you have worked with?</strong></p>
<p>All species have their perks and difficulties. I wouldn’t be able to tell.</p>
<p><strong>How do you understand the behavior of animals?</strong></p>
<p>We normally try to condense behavior into variables that we can measure. That help us build theories we can test with more experiments.</p>
<p><strong>What is the dominant mammalian animal species used in a neuroscience research?</strong></p>
<p>By dominant I pressume you mean frequent. It’s probably mice (<em>mus musculus</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Do you ever get intimidated by others in your same career?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, unfortunately, science is not devoid of hierarchical structures and people at the top can be scary sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>What type of breakfast do you have every morning?</strong></p>
<p>I have either a toast with cream cheese or an omlette. Some fruit maybe, banana milkshake if I’m feeling like it’s a special day. Tea always.</p>
<p><strong>How hard did you work to have this job?</strong></p>
<p>Not like REALLY REALLY hard. Coal miners have it way worse than me, and they have to work in a harmful environment (for a lot less pay!). That being said, I feel that I have had to put effort into it, it was not automatic.</p>
<p><strong>Is it true that if humans eat other humans their brains get damaged and if it is true why it only affects humans?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, if they it other human brains and those brains have something called prions, it can happen. It’s not specific to humans, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy">Bovine spongiform encephalopathy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How you compare your work with your social life?</strong> // <strong>Do you have extra time for your family and other business?</strong> // <strong>How do you manage to balance your work and your social life?</strong></p>
<p>During the week, work comes first. During the weekend, social life comes first. About the “other business”, I’m not sure, do you have an offer I can’t refuse?</p>
<p><strong>Are there any animal models of self-mutilation?</strong></p>
<p>I have not come across any during my experience, but other people definitely have something to say about it, see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22231807">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is something you always wanted to do that you have not done it yet and why?</strong></p>
<p>I have visited many places in the World. I still would like to travel more.</p>
<p><strong>Even though humans are more envolved, do animals have a more complex brain?</strong></p>
<p>Humans are not <em>more evolved</em><sup>2</sup>. Human brains are definitely <em>more complex</em>.</p>
<p><strong>What concepts of the study of animals you dislike the most?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing I should note is that, regardless of how careful and caring we are, we won’t be able to do neuroscience without intervention on animals. These animals live confined and we often perform surgeries on them. That’s not awesome, but it’s</p>
<p>Beyond that, I would say I don’t like the fact that we can’t talk to them. They can’t express how they <em>feel</em>, what’s going on on their minds whenever we study them. We have to work around this, infer their mental state from other variables.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever be surprised by an animal case with a mutation?</strong></p>
<p>We work with mutants all the time. A mutation is not how you might see it pictured in movies. In fact, your own DNA is mutating <em>all the time, for the rest of your life</em>. That being said, there are certain mutations that produce very interesting effects (we call them phenotypes). Here’s the ob/ob mouse model:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>ob/ob mouse on the left, normal mouse on the right</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>These animals can’t produce leptin, a hormone involved in energy balance and metabolism. They never experience a signal that tells them to stop eating (leptin) and hence they eat much more and gain a lot of weight.</p>
</section>
<section id="questions-about-argentina" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="questions-about-argentina">Questions about Argentina</h2>
<p><strong>Where would you have liked to study if it wasn’t in Argentina?</strong></p>
<p>Probably in Europe. Assuming I have to do it in English, the UK, or any international school in Germany, Switzerland or Finland. Assuming I speak German, in Germany or Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think Argentina is one of the most expensive countries to study in?</strong> // <strong>Do you consider Argentina a country where is rentable to study?</strong> // <strong>Do you think Argentina is one of the most expensive countries to go study?</strong></p>
<p>Education in Argentina at public unviersities is <strong>free</strong>. The overall quality is good, even compared to top schools in the US or Europe.</p>
</section>
<section id="on-favorites" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-favorites">On favorites</h2>
<p>I am <em>really really bad</em> at chosing favorites and don’t like rankings. But below is my attempt to answer these questions.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite aspect of your research?</strong></p>
<p>Thinking about questions and making theories about how the whole thing works.</p>
<p><strong>What is your all time favorite book?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t have a favorite book. You can see the books I have read in the last years <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/51876682">here</a>. There’s a lot of books I have read but not registered (sorry about that <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>)</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite series?</strong></p>
<p>I’m not good with choosing favorites, so I will go with the one I’ve watched the most growing up: The Simpsons.</p>

<p>Hace rato que vengo viendo ciertas tendencias de gente que hace algo de análisis de datos con la actualidad Argentina. Por ejemplo, <a href="https://twitter.com/danyscht">Daniel Schteingart</a> comúnmente publica este tipo de análisis en diversos medios. Esto me llevó a buscar datos abiertos disponibles para jugar un rato.</p>
<p>En general, a mí me interesa más debatir sobre la implementación de políticas y pienso que el Poder Legislativo merece mayor atención. Siento que sobrestimamos (para bien y para mal) el poder de un Ejecutivo que es, al final del día, mucho menos determinante que aquellos que escriben las leyes según las cuales se rige el Estado. Exigimos representantes que nos representen.</p>
<section id="senadores" class="level1">
<h1>Senadores</h1>
<p><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senado_de_la_Naci%C3%B3n_Argentina">Wikipedia</a> dice: “El Senado es el órgano federal por excelencia del país, donde cada senador representa los intereses de su provincia.”. Basta con leer la introducción del artículo para recordarse a uno mismo por qué es tan importante tener un Senado que funcione. Entre otras tareas sin mundanas, aparentemente el Senado tiene la potestad de “autorizar al presidente de la Nación para que declare el estado de sitio” y de asegurar una correcta distribución de los recursos federales. Quizás cuesta entender por qué los requisitos para ser Senador son tan bajos<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>Pues bien, entonces comencemos por el Senado ya que tiene, además, la base de datos más completa. Antes que nada, un pequeño repaso sobre cómo se eligen los representantes y la duración de sus mandatos.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Elecciones. La cámara de Senadores se renueva por tercios cada dos años. Los senadores son electos directamente por el pueblo. Los mandatos de los senadores son por seis años y pueden ser reelegidos en sus funciones indefinidamente.</p>

<p>Las bases de datos utilizadas en este artículo son de acceso público. La base de datos de Senadores puede encontrarse en www.senado.gov.ar y www.congreso.gob.ar.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="senadores-por-período">Senadores por período</h2>
<p>Empecemos mirando cómo evolucionaron las bancas a lo largo de nuestra historia. Vemos un comienzo con algo de recambio, seguido de un período con bajo recambio. A partir de 1930, empezamos a ver los vaivenes de un país pendular que recae en dictaduras con disolución del Poder Legislativo. Las últimas dos dictaduras están marcadas en rojo, seguidas de un alto recambio en el número de bancas (asignación de nuevos Senadores cuando se restituye el Poder Legislativo). El otro pico que llama la atención es el 2001, máximo evento de recambio en nuestra historia. Hoy por hoy, podría decirse que gozamos de unas dos décadas de estabilidad en las instituciones, en donde vemos un recambio de entre 20 y 30 bancas regularmente.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cuánto-dura-un-período">¿Cuánto dura un período?</h2>
<p>La longitud de los mandatos ha cambiado a lo largo de la historia. Además, existieron períodos en los cuales intentar ser senador no parecía una carrera a largo término (cortesía de la inestabilidad de las instituciones argentinas durante gran parte del siglo XX).</p>
<p>Un gran número de senadores no cumplen su mandato completo, ya sea por muerte, renuncia (a veces para ocupar otro cargo) o por destitución. Afortunadamente, en las últimas décadas, la tendencia parece estabilizarse hacia la longitud de mandato designada en la ley.</p>

<section id="quién-quiere-repetir" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quién-quiere-repetir">¿Quién quiere repetir?</h2>
<p>La permanencia de un senador – o de cualquier otro político – en el cargo es un tema de debate interesante. En primer lugar, uno esperaría que cualquier trabajador con experienca y conocimiento sobre su área sea más eficiente y productivo. En criollo, si me tengo que operar de apendicitis mañana, prefiero un médico que haya realizado 1350 cirugías de apéndice que uno que haya realizado 12<sup>2</sup>. Luego, si trasladamos este razonamiento a nuestras instituciones deberíamos querer que el Senado esté compuesto de políticos con muchos años de experiencia en la cámara alta.</p>
<p>El problema radica en identificar cuáles son los puestos que se parecen al del médico haciendo la misma cirugía y aquellos que no. Tomemos el ejemplo de los burócratas del Estado de carrera, los estadístas, los responsables de mantenimiento de infraestructura. Esta es la gente que hace funcionar el aparato, sin ellos, no hay implementación, no hay político que pueda hacer nada. Una cosa podría que identificarlos es que todos ellos deberían ser apolíticos y, como tales, deberían poder cumplir su labor siendo independientes del gobierno de turno<sup>3</sup>. Los investigadores del CONICET y los maestros también son buenos ejemplos de este tipo de empleados de Estado<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>En cambio, el rol de los integrantes del Poder Legislativo está contaminado por el hecho de que, entre otras cosas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Legislan su propio salario.</li>
<li>Tienen la postestad de regular actividades económicas de manera conveniente.</li>
<li>Tienen re-elección indefinida.</li>
</ol>
<p>Por supuesto, podemos sumar el cúmulo de <em>beneficios legales</em> (como canjear viáticos por dinero en efectivo y discresionalidad de presupuesto) y aquellos <em>no legales</em> (en criollo, corrupción). Pero éste no es el lugar para analizar eso, focalicemos en los períodos. Los datos mandan, así que veamos qué es lo que dicen. Históricamente, la gran mayoría de senadores no repite su cargo.</p>

<p>Acá vemos por primera vez algunos nombres que suenan más a calle o a localidad que a lo que hicieron. Pero también vemos algunos nombres bastante familiares y actuales. Recordemos que 4 o 5 mandatos son, según la duración de mandato actual, entre 24 y 30 años en el mismo puesto!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="máximos-reemplazantes">Máximos reemplazantes</h3>
<p>Una curiosidad ingenua me llevó a preguntarme cuáles son los máximos reemplaznates. Me pregunté si, quizás, existía una caja con senadores de repuesto que pudieran cumplir los roles una vez que la figurita política de turno lograba conseguir los votos.</p>
<p>En otras palabras: ¿Es posible que exista un grupo de senadores <em>comodín</em>? Los datos presentan una triste realidad, una en la que la historia del Poder Legislativo Argentino está contaminada por sucesivas <em>disoluciones</em>. Llamémosles por su nombre, Golpes de Estado. Aún así, hay algunos senadores que han tomado la posta como suplente en reiteradas ocasiones.</p>

<p>Sólo dos ejemplos, el resto de tarea:</p>
<p><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Ram%C3%B3n_Vidal">Vidal</a> fue gobernador de la provincia de Corrientes (dos veces), diputado, senador por 32 años (literalmente hasta su muerte, a los 80 años). <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eriberto_Mendoza">Mendoza</a> fue legislador provincial, diputado, gobernador de San Luis y luego senador por 27 años.</p>
<p>Independientemente de lo grandiosas o nefastas de sus contribuciones y el servicio a su País, queda claro que la carrera política les permitió perpetuarse de formas que no sólo son imposibles en la mayoría de otros gremios, sino que son mucho más peligrosas para la Nación.</p>
<p>Una cosa que resulta interesante es que pareciera que existen dos tipos de senadoes. Existe un quiebre entre aquellos que se quedan 1 o 2 mandatos y los demás, que se perpetúan en el cargo al mejor estilo Julio Grondona (<code>#TodoPasa</code>).</p>

<p>Es interesante que en ningún momento busqué los 10 años como punto de quiebre, este valor surgió de hacer una simple regresión partida. Podemos ver que los casos más extremos se desvían bastante de la regresión (sugiriendo un incremento aún más fuerte que uno lineal), pero me pareció una forma de simplificar el asunto: más de dos mandatos y estás para quedarte, no por un rato, para quedarte a vivir.</p>

<p>A pesar que los ejemplos con el récord de días tienen más de un siglo, la realidad es que, desde el retorno a la democracia, el cierto grado de estabilidad institucional ha permitido que estas prácticas se exacerben.</p>
<p>En el siguiente gráfico muestra los períodos de los 60 legisladores con mayor cantidad de días en el poder. Vale recalcar que dos mandatos de 9 años te colocan muy arriba en el el ránking, mientras que necesitarías 3 mandatos completos con la nueva longitud de 6 años para llegar a la misma cantidad. Es fácil ver que, entre 1850 y 1930, existieron períodos con ciertos senadores ocupando las bancas de manera prolongada. Sin embargo, estamos hablando de un período político en donde ni siquiera se había legislado la <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ley_S%C3%A1enz_Pe%C3%B1a">Ley Saenz Peña</a> o recién se había implementado. Ver tanto abuso no es sorprendente si el proceso es fundamentalmente anti-democrático y los períodos son tan largos.</p>
<p>Desde el último retorno a la democracia, un número importante de senadores se han perpetuado de manera impresionante, incluso integrando más de un partido político (ver también el color de la camiseta).</p>

<p>Además de demostrar lealtad a su partido, los senadores son representantes según su provincia. Uno esperaría que tengan fuerte arraigo y sean portavoces de las necesidades particulares de aquellos a los que representan. Esto, en gran medida, se ve reflejado en que la mayoría de senadores únicamente se presenta por una provincia. Sin embargo, hay senadores fueron electos en más de una provincia:</p>

<p>Un hecho más interesante es el cambio de partido. No me queda claro si esto habla de la inestabilidad en el tiempo de los partidos o de que algunos senadores se orientan con la corriente (por ponerlo de manera políticamente correcta).</p>

<p>Por pura diversión, imaginemos que queremos crear un partido político en argentina. Pero no queremos un partido cualquiera, queremos un partido que logre poner bancas en el senado.

<p>El siguiente gráfico muestra cómo están conectados los senadores con los distintos partidos. Es interesante ver la corriente ideológica del justicialismo, desde el Peronismo hasta el Frente para la Victoria. También es bastante claro el bunker de la UCR.</p>

<li id="fn4"><p>Incluso en estas circunstancias, no considero que los investigadores o los maestros deban estar haciendo siempre la misma tarea. Al contrario, sendos gremios deberían funcionar con una estructura que permita aprovechar la experiencia para el mejor funcionamiento en vez de promover una jerarquía absurda por la jerarquía misma. Una científica jóven quizás esté mejor capacitada para hacer experimentos con sus propias manos. Un maestro jóven para interactuar con alumnos sin que haya un salto generacional muy pronunciado. Aquellos que tengan mayor experiencia, quizás pueda impulsar cambios estructurales para mejorar aspectos que no estén funcionando.↩︎</p></li>

  <title>Birthday Meritocracy</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>We believe in meritocracy as one of the cornerstones of Western civilization. This idea is so embedded in our culture that we seldom question it. We praise those driven individuals who combine effort and talent to make it to the top. They smile in the cover of the magazines, the dreams of children and the nightmares of adults. Sports might be the activity where the <em>blood, sweat and tears</em> feel the most real and therefore are most notoriously broadcasted to the world.</p>
<p>The <em>beautiful game</em> is no exception. But what if we were wrong about the meritocracy assumption? What if there were random events that sneak in the player selection process? What if such events were not negligible, but heavily influenced what players that make it to the top?</p>
<section id="one-trimester" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-trimester">One trimester</h2>
<p>Three or four months of difference at 25 year old is nothing<sup>1</sup>. Moreover, for most purposes in adult life, such a small difference in age is considered zero. But elite athletes are not ordinary adults and we don’t care about most of their purposes in life. We want them to do one thing extraordinarily well.</p>
<p>What could a trimester difference do to a 25 year old, prime time, football player? You might still find yourself asking this question and this question might sound reasonable. But the data looks quite different. Let’s take a look.</p>

<section id="the-database" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-database">The database</h2>
<p>I compiled a small database of football players from www.soccerwiki.com. This database is not perfectly complete, but contains enough players to provide support to the general idea. Here’s a table of the number of players by country:</p>

<p>This looks quite strange, there’s a clear trend, with most players being born in the first months of the year. Maybe it’s a seasonal thing?</p>
<p>Well…It’s quite difficult to support the idea that players born on any season are better. For example, January in Brazil means blazing hot summer while it’s freezing cold winter in Germany. Still, both countries seem to produce the most number of players in the first month of the year. In fact, the data show that being born on the first trimester after the cutoff date (e.g, January to March if cutoff is January 1st) increases the chances of being a top player by a huge margin.</p>
</section>
<section id="analysis-by-position" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-by-position">Analysis by position</h2>
<p>There might be some logic behind this phenomenon. Maybe the birth effect is big for positions most strongly associated with bare physical strength. Thus, we could expect to find a stronger effect for those in defensive positions (i.e, Goalkeeper up to Defensive Midfielders) and find a broader distribution of birth dates for those positions that are reserved for the creatives and magicians of the ball, the offensive players.</p>

<p>Again, the evidence for a strong bias favoring players born on the first trimester is compelling. What’s going on here?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-one-percent-difference">The one percent difference</h2>
<p>This is not a post about how the top athletes distinguish themselves from the rest because of their talent and effort. This post is about something completely out of their control: their birth dates. Yes, it sounds crazy, but the month of birth plays a huge role in the success of a football player.</p>
<p>Football schools around the world are normally organized around the calendar year. It makes sense, if you are going to make a tournament for kids, instead of having kids of different ages competing together, you grab all the kids born on a same year and make them play against each other (5 year-old kids vs other 5 year-old kids). For example, when I was playing these tournaments, I played in the 1991 category.</p>
<p>Scouts and coaches might decide to <em>promote</em> a strong/talented kid. In my case, I <em>could</em> play for the 1990 or 1989 categories. But we all agree that it would be unfair to <em>downgrade</em> me to play for the 1995 category. I would have a huge developmental advantage. So far so good, but there’s something that escapes from everyone: <strong>one year is a lot of time</strong>. The developmental difference between a 5 year old kid born at the beginning of the year (e.g, January 1st) vs one at the very end (e.g, December 31st) is huge.</p>
<p>Let’s take a less extreme case, kids born with a 180 days difference. That amount of days corresponds to an extra fraction of life lived (aka experience, aka time kicking the ball) of 0.1. It might sound like very little but that 10% advantage will definitely compound over the competitive career.</p>

<section id="logic-behind" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="logic-behind">Logic behind</h2>
<p>It turns out to be that scouts and coaches <em>think</em> they are selecting the best, but they are selecting the <em>oldest</em>. The January 1st cutoff is arbitrary and favors those born close to the date, who will be slightly stronger/faster/better only because they have had more time to play around in the world and, basically, <em>grow</em>. If you look closely, the only country that does not follow the pattern is the UK. But, yes, you guessed it, the cutoff date for the UK is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-32064842">August 31st</a>.</p>
<p>Players that are selected as the best normally play in the starting team and stay in the field more minutes each game [Experience based, Citation needed]. They get better training and more opportunities to play, either because they play more or because coaches pay more attention to them. Each extra minute reinforces the small initial difference, creating a real one. Of course, talent and effort play a role. But it consistently turns out to be that players born earlier on the calendar year end up being better than the other players. This phenomenon is known as relative age effect <sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Whenever we see skewed age distributions we should suspect it is likely due to arbitrary cuts. The magic ingredients go like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make an arbitrary cut.</li>
<li>Select those that are a tad ahead, those closest to the cut (older people relative to cut).</li>
<li>Differentiate training experience by giving more opportunities to those already ahead.</li>
<li>Harvest the best players (older people relative to cut).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is difficult to detect because it’s a self-fulfilled profecy for scouts (after all, they want their picks to end up being good). Basketball doesn’t have this kind of problem, mostly because availability of opportunities to train and the absence of strict cutoff dates. But in other sports, this effect is even more marked. In ice hockey, you are mostly constrained to the winter season to play and you need a rink, which puts more barriers on training<sup>3</sup>.</p>
</section>
<section id="market-value" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="market-value">Market Value</h2>
<p>I couldn’t scrape enough to make a case about market value. But a quick Google search lead me to a paper suggesting that, although month of birth has a big effect in the frequency of players, once the pros made it, their salaries are not related to such factor <sup>4</sup>.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-bad-news" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-bad-news">The bad news</h2>
<p>This effect transcends beyond sports. Turns out that arbitrary cutoffs during development affect academic performance. Kids born near the cutoff perform better at school and go to better universities. I cannot stop thinking that I was somewhat fortunate in this account. Overall, school never felt like too difficult. But maybe it’s because I had had enough days on earth and was mature enough to grasp concepts. Maybe it’s not only that “Math and Science came easy to me and I liked them”. Maybe I was born at the correct moment and I wouldn’t be pursuing academic endeavors if I hadn’t been born around the cutoff date in my country (July 1st).</p>
<p>Dividing school kids by age is retrograde. I would like to see a continuous progress with no boundaries on dates. I would like to see no kid be made to wait because he isn’t old enough yet and, more importantly, I would like to see no hurrying kids through content because their age says so. I would like to see people moving through school at their own pace<sup>5</sup>. Maybe we should start looking at performance adjusted by age, it might be the antidote we are looking for.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-silverlining" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-silverlining">The silverlining</h2>
<p>We can account for this effect and attempt to correct it! Some countries have started to make adjustments to the birth effect in football. An easy way of doing it is using two cutoff dates and training coaches (and scouts) against their bias.</p>
<p>Solving this issue might require clubs to have two teams per year. This measure doesn’t have to go all the way until they are pro, but at least until kids are old enough, so that we keep below the 6-8 month difference. This will possibly increase the costs for everyone and makes logistics more difficult. However, we would see a huge increase in the production of players (and/or their quality) if we just change this arbitrary dates.</p>
</section>
<section id="wait-a-second" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wait-a-second">Wait a second</h2>
<p>There’s a possible hypothesis I’ve been evading. The reasoning will be like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The frequency of Football players is a proportion of the people born in a country.</li>
<li>The frequency of births in the whole country is higher in the months that the Football Associations of each country use as cutoffs.</li>
</ol>
<p>If both things were true, then that explains why we see a peak of players in January (or whatever the specific month of cutoff date is). I will use data from my country to show that births do not follow Football.</p>
</section>
<section id="argentina" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="argentina">Argentina</h2>
<p>My country is well known for the production and exportation of football players. I had access to data on births in Buenos Aires. I later gained access to the data for the whole country, which showed mostly the same trend (you can see it at the very bottom of the article). The number of births in Argentina are somewhat constant. If anything, March seems to be the month with most consistent high amount of births.</p>

<p>This post is made as a backup for the data visualization challenge number 2. Data comes from the daily posts of the members of the Data Visualization Society (DVS) on the DVS Slack channels. You can see everybody’s submissions for the challenge <a href="https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/challenge2">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am also very motivated to explore the dark versions of the ggplot themes. The package I’m going to be using is called <code>ggdark</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s perform some summary stats. There’s 62 channels, but I will focus on the top 15 channels as ranked by their total volume of characters. I’m using this metric because the correlation between characters and the number of posts is, naturally, good.</p>

<p>A good way of seeing how the top channels are ordered according to output is to do an ordered boxplot.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>I am keen on tracking things. Some people call this <em>personal analytics</em>, I call it fun. In this post, I will explore how to extract your email information using python and R. My goal is to do some analysis on the data and, hopefully, explore different visualizations that can inform future behavior.</p>
<section id="emails-from-gmail" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="emails-from-gmail">Emails from Gmail</h2>
<p>Reading emails in python is quite simple, we need to import the mailbox library. My file is called <code>correo</code> and comes from downloading my Gmail stuff out of https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout. It can take a while so be patient.</p>
<p>This should return something that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>X-GM-THRID
X-Gmail-Labels
Received
MIME-Version
Date
To
From
Subject
Content-Type
Content-Disposition
Message-Id</code></pre>
<p>Let’s save the info we care about into a new file. We select <code>subject</code>, <code>from</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>to</code>, and some variables that allow us to keep track of things (i.e, labels and threads).</p>
</section>
<section id="emails-from-thunderbird" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="emails-from-thunderbird">Emails from Thunderbird</h2>
<p>I keep 3 accounts in Thunderbird. Using the <a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools/">ImportExportTools Add-on</a>, I exported things into <code>.mbox</code> format. Following a similar procedure to the one depicted above, I got the other three accounts exported to <code>.csv</code> files. Just be sure you select the correct keys (see example below, this might change for other email clients).</p>
</section>
<section id="data-cleaning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-cleaning">Data cleaning</h2>
<p>Let’s switch from python to R<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, emails come tagged (things like <code>"\\?="</code> and other nasty stuff) and you might have to deal with different encodings (the perks of speaking multiple languages). As an example, let’s see what Quora sends me.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>                                                             from
1                         Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
2                         Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
3                         Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
4  =?utf-8?q?Selecci=C3=B3n_de_Quora?= &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
5                         Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
6                         Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
7                         Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
8  =?utf-8?q?Selecci=C3=B3n_de_Quora?= &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
9  =?utf-8?q?Selecci=C3=B3n_de_Quora?= &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
10 =?utf-8?q?Selecci=C3=B3n_de_Quora?= &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>That’s nasty…Let’s do some cleaning. This function comes really handy for text replacement.</p>
<p>We are going to modify the function a bit, we add <code>x</code> as the string we pass for cleaning and we will remove the tags progressively.</p>
<p>We are ready to use our super cool function and clean the text! Not perfect, but gets us 90% of the way.</p>
<p>Let’s see how emails from Quora changed with this new encoding:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>                                            from
1        Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
2        Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
3        Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
4  Selección_de_Quora &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
5        Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
6        Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
7        Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
8  Selección_de_Quora &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
9  Selección_de_Quora &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;
10 Selección_de_Quora &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s filter those from “Received” or “Sent” (in Spanish, “Recibidos” or “Enviado”).</p>
<p>To save you from reading a considerable amount of code, I will load the other accounts and modify them accordingly in the background. I will finally merge everything together. Just enjoy the kitten while the code is running in my machine.</p>

</section>
<section id="analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>There’s still some stuff to clean, but I’d rather go into the analysis. So, let’s get some questions to guide our purpose:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Who sends me the most emails? Who receives emails from me?</li>
<li>When do I get emails (mostly)?</li>
<li>When should I do something about it (aka, reply)?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> We have to dance with parsing dates and times. I highly recommend being familiar with <code>lubridate</code> (for example, see https://rdrr.io/cran/lubridate/man/parse_date_time.html).</p>

<p>It’s cool to know that my lingering feeling (“wow…<code>Quora</code> just spams the hell out of me”) is supported by data. Other big spammers are, of course, the Bank and Amazon. People I work with and friends come high up too. Funny to see Mendeley and Pubchase on the top ten, it’s been a long journey of them sending me papers, thank you for that<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="working-with-dates-and-times">Working with dates and times</h2>
<p>Every time I have to deal with dates, I have a miniature panic attack. As a general rule, you have to have all the variables that you want to use as separate columns (i.e, year, month, day, week_day, time, …). The <code>lubridate</code> package helps a lot, but it’s still quite an effort.</p>
<p>Working only with times of the day, regardless of date itself is problematic. Working with periods is difficult, so <code>as.numeric(x, "hour")</code> is a friend.</p>
<p>Here’s a hint of how the <code>date</code> column in the original data actually looks like. This may or might not look the same way for you, it depends on your date settings.</p>

<p>Let’s create all the variables we need. It seems like a lot because it <em>should</em> work out of the box and it doesn’t, but it’s actually somewhat straight-forward to get most of what we want.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how the whole email movement looks like. In the last couple of years, I clearly felt the load rising and rising. The lack of data in the early years is mostly due to me not downloading everything from the Hotmail account (it’s too late, too far in the past to fix :P). Besides, the trend likely holds quite well.</p>

<p>This is not really surprising, given the amount of unsolicited advertising I started getting since the move. Yes, I’m talking to you again Quora/Amazon/people trying to sell me stuff<sup>3</sup>. Of course, University related chains likely take a big chunk of the pie.</p>
<p>I don’t feel like parsing out each sender out of the sheer amount. I have had the Gmail and Hotmail accounts for more than 10 years, but the University email is something relatively recent. All in all, considering the time I’ve had each account, the input rate coming from universities worries me. Here are the total email for each account:</p>

<p>Let’s add the time of the day to the equation. This plot was made using <code>ggbeeswarm</code> package, I highly recommend checking it, it’s pure power. I got help to put the labels in the <code>y</code> axis from ‘00:00’ to ‘24:00’. You can find a toy example in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55463735/how-to-force-scale-y-datetime-scale-to-show-2400-instead-of-0000-in-r/55464995#55464995">this StackOverflow question</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see from the figures above, the emails in the received bucket have two humps (wink, Bactrian camel, little prince), but I send emails at almost all times (except maybe between 2 AM and 5 AM). This is a <strong>bad habit</strong>, I should not be sending emails all the time, I should batch to diminish the costs associated with shifting tasks. I could just put a rule of thumb and check emails only once a day (e.g, 12:00:00). However, this might not be the best decision, because it chunks the response time in two very broad categories (either I get back to you somewhat quick, within 2 hours, or I take almost a full day to reply).</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Additionally, checking emails only once might make me miss something somewhat fleeting. In general, I want to read things during the time they are relevant (did anybody say free pizza?).</p>
<p>The primary goal, then, is to minimize the times I check/send emails without <strong>1)</strong> impacting my perceived response rate and <strong>2)</strong> missing out too much info during the day. But that optimization problem is hard to solve and likely a waste of time (trust me, I tried and I’m not that smart).</p>
<p>I believe we can solve it with a rule of thumb anyway. Let’s say, I would check emails <em>twice</em> a day and respond immediately, unless I need to harness some brain power to create an elaborate response<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>I just wrote a “cost function” and calculated the cost for several combinations of times.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I have had <em>a lot</em> of fun doing this project. I also experienced an enormous amount of frustration with dates. Moreover, every time I thought this project was over, a new little idea for a <em>not so little</em> graph came into my mind. Of course, I went after it. I hope this info helps other people take a look at their own personal analytics and make some decisions. I am somewhat happy I have almost all notifications turned off (hence, no Facebook/Twitter/Slack/whatever appearing as top senders). In fact, turning email notifications off is the first thing I do when I sign up for a service/site, I encourage you to do the same.</p>
<p>Batching is something I will start testing. I can’t control my input but, hopefully, the distributions of my sent email will start matching the times I designated. More importantly, people will not notice, even if the email input keeps increasing.</p>

<p>Some people requested me to do the following scatter-plot. I went with the ggbeeswarm version on the text because I find it more appealing.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>Here’s how the story usually goes: It starts with you, sitting in front of the computer screen, thinking: <em>What a lovely day for some data analysis!</em>.</p>
<p>This day is great because you have collected some data or maybe because you happened to find some data somewhere, begging to be part of a smoking good plot.</p>
<section id="raw-data-inside-tin-software" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="raw-data-inside-tin-software">Raw data inside Tin Software</h2>
<p>Having data feels so good, that itching feeling in your fingers, the rush to know. How does it look like? You <em>need</em> to know. But let’s be honest, no dataset comes clean. You have to fight your way to finally get the squeaky clean readable <code>data.frame</code>.</p>
<p>Why is data <em>dirty</em>? Well, there are many reasons. Today I want to focus on the manufacturers.</p>
<p>Manufacturers don’t care for tidiness or openness, they use the format that works for them. They care for proprietary software solutions that help them help you, for a little contribution <sup>1</sup>.</p>
</section>
<section id="reclaiming-your-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reclaiming-your-data">Reclaiming your data</h2>
<p>Of course, your data is your <em>own</em> and there has to be a way of getting it out of the tin software. So, you pull up your sleeves and go for it: <em>there must be a way to get a text file out of this</em>. Fortunately, but not after a lot of clicking, you find a way to get your <code>raw_data.csv</code> file exported.</p>
</section>
<section id="untitled1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="untitled1">Untitled1</h2>
<p>You are now more than ready to <code>read.csv(...)</code> your file. You open a new empty script and rush through commands. Read it. Do some quick wrangling. Maybe even a manual edit? The goal at this stage is to swift through it. You accept hard-coding some values, why not?</p>
<p><code>df &lt;- df[3:3245, 18:22]</code> doesn’t sound that bad at this stage.</p>
<p>Before you can tell, you end up with less than 50 lines of code that accomplish the task, a sort of <code>x + y + z -&gt; result</code>. This feels good!</p>
</section>
<section id="plot" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>You plot the data. Yes, you might even use <em>base graphics</em> at this stage. It looks horrible, but the relationship is there, and you smile. It’s encouraging, in your next meeting, you will discuss the great advances in your research line (added n=3 to a group).</p>
</section>
<section id="periodic" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="periodic">Periodic</h2>
<p>But something holds you when you try to escape back to the real world. You know that this process is gonna happen more than once. Hopefully, every week or so, you’re going to get your <code>sample of interest</code> read in that <code>machine of hell</code> and, if you want a quick taste of that sweet data, you’d better clean your script and make it a nice <em>pipeline</em>. Here’s where your Advanced R (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) voice whispers to you: <em>Everything to parameters, parameters to functions.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="functions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>Let’s think in more general terms now…Where is the regular expressions God when I need it?</p>
<p>You don’t really remember, but there’s Google and there’s <code>stringr</code>. You’re quite sure you’ll find a way to extract all relevant info and recycle it through the pipeline. You create universal values that are shared, <code>ID_this</code>, <code>ID_that</code>. Naming names wasn’t that difficult after all!</p>
<p>Your vision is still clear, maybe it’s because of the coffee, so you quickly wrap your sequential steps into functions that directly resemble them. You proudly name the files after the steps they perform (as if you would remember what <code>clean_and_tidy_df.R</code> does three months from now).</p>
<p>You still have a sequence: it now looks like <code>x = f(...) + y = g(...) + z = h(...) -&gt; result</code>. Not bad for a couple hours of work!</p>
</section>
<section id="climax" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="climax">Climax</h2>
<p>You find yourself at the climax of your endeavor. You can easily do a sequence of calls to functions. Moreover, everything is fresh in your memory and you have not tested your functions extensively. Things appear to work because you haven’t invested enough effort to break them.</p>
<ul>
<li>What will happen when dates change?</li>
<li>Is your description of the problem(s) correct?</li>
<li>Are your solutions working despite not being authoritative (aka, how many unknown unknowns waiting to bite you?)?</li>
<li>You are the only one running this code now, is that going to be the case <em>forever</em>?</li>
<li>Packages will update tomorrow. Are you ready for that?</li>
</ul>
<p>All this ignorance feels a lot like happiness. Again, you are strongly tempted to get up from your desk and go live your life.</p>
</section>
<section id="wake-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wake-up">Wake up</h2>
<p>It doesn’t really matter how long it takes, your code will break. You realize your functions depend on global parameters, the date, the folder structure, the file names, and a stupid pattern on row 7 that is manually typed on <code>machine of hell</code> and therefore might contain human errors.</p>
<p>You cry, at least for a microsecond. Then you decide it’s time to bring the big guns to the fight. Everything will be standardized. It’s time for <code>list.files()</code> and <code>lapply()</code> to save the day.</p>
</section>
<section id="everything-is-a-list" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="everything-is-a-list">Everything is a list</h2>
<p>You create <code>wrapper_of_clean_and_tidy_df.R</code> and all sorts of other wrapper functions that can handle lists. Why? Because <em>everything is a list now</em>. You will load all the data, make a huge list, loop over, and apply all-purpose functions. Remember <code>x</code>? Neither do I, but it’s somewhere there, running at the bottom.</p>
<p>But this <code>list -&gt; list -&gt; list -&gt; list of results</code> is a bit confusing, where is the stuff I care about?. Don’t even get me started with the lists of lists.</p>
</section>
<section id="checkpoints" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="checkpoints">Checkpoints</h2>
<p>By this point, even if you will be the only one running this code, you are in deep need of some hints that point you towards what is going on.</p>
<p>You also have big objects that were only meaningful on the very first time, things that you never want to calculate again. But <em>What if some day…?</em> Yes, you know how this one goes. So, go ahead, you are allowed to add this line:</p>
<p><code>readline(prompt = "This was only computed once in the life of the Universe, compute again [Y/N]? &gt; ")</code></p>
<p>Checkpoints are also useful tools to handle errors that might come in the data, find typos, sort out dates, prevent the wrong data type from entering a function, among others.</p>
<p>For example, you might be expecting something that looks like <code>yyyy-mm-dd_filename.csv</code>, but for some reason you end up trying to read <code>other_filename.csv</code>. Well, good luck converting <code>other</code> to date format. Moreover, are you really trying to use <code>"[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}"</code> as the pattern to match to <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code>? Come on…you can do better than this!</p>
<p>Wondering where are those <code>NAs</code> coming from? Wondering what’s the length of a <code>NULL</code> character? Been there, done that. Don’t worry, enough checkpoints can solve the problem.</p>
<p>At this point, after another couple hours, your code is working under several layers of <code>if(condition) {...} else {...}</code> statements. Good job, feeling like a programmer yet?</p>
</section>
<section id="what-does-the-code-do-again" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-the-code-do-again">What does the code do again?</h2>
<p>Because your code is now looking like:</p>
<p><code>wrapper of wrapper of x + wrapper of wrapper of y + wrapper of wrapper of z -&gt; ???</code></p>
<p>You have no idea what’s going on unless you run the whole chain. But you did your work and it pays off. The code works like a charm! You can see lines of code dropping, messages being printed, prompts being asked and answered, graphs popping every now and then. You even check some errors by trying to run corrupted data, errors are being thrown! Heaven.</p>
<p>You are ready now, the code is working, time to collect a <em>shit ton</em> of data.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-are-you-doing-this-to-yourself" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-are-you-doing-this-to-yourself">Why are you doing this to yourself?</h2>
<p>You didn’t optimize for <em>that</em> much data. Your code is now running at a brand new speed: <em>turtle</em>. You can go get coffee, stop to chat a for a while with the students in another lab and come back to the computer, only to see it improve a few % points.</p>
<p>You did this to yourself. You don’t need those 17 extra plots in between calculations every single time. You have no time to look at them if you are running hundreds of tiny files as inputs. Besides, you already know that your method works, the calibration curve is calibrated and the machine parameters lie within the expected distribution.</p>
</section>
<section id="save-before-continue" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="save-before-continue">Save before continue</h2>
<p>Gaming rules apply: before fighting the boss, save the game, just in case you know…you die in the fight. You don’t want to start all over, do you?</p>
<p>But we seldom do this unless we absolutely have to. We don’t like to leave a trail of intermediate computations. In a sense, this might be dangerous, what if something broke in between, but because we have an old copy we are able to go through the pipeline without noticing? It makes me cringe.</p>
<p>But you don’t want to calculate years of data just to look how much the new addition changes the output, right? Start saving intermediate steps!</p>
</section>
<section id="package" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="package">Package</h2>
<p>You said you were going to have the data analysed by tomorrow, but you spent the whole day waiting for it to run, debugging and trying to make the pipeline even more tight. That thing you did, the saving intermediate files, turned out to be far more complicated than what you expected. You realized exactly how many environment variables were being created and used during the pipeline. You re-learn the term <code>scoping</code> and you learn to worship it. Nah, 10 arguments it’s not too much, you will <em>surely</em> remember them all when you call the function! No data so far, no data that you can <em>show</em> to another human being.</p>
<p>It’s well past midnight, your eyes hurt, there’s no more ice cream to keep you excited. But a question creeps into your mind, a revelation:</p>
<p><em>Should I start from scratch and make this my own package? Yes..that’s what I’m gonna do…!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Stop! It’s a trap!</p>
</section>
<section id="steps-of-the-race-to-the-bottom" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="steps-of-the-race-to-the-bottom">Steps of the race to the bottom</h2>
<p>Just as recap…be my guest.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You have a <code>raw_data.csv</code>.</li>
<li>You open an empty script (<em>Untitled1</em>) and write a few lines that do sequentially something like x + y + z -&gt; result.</li>
<li>You make a <em>very</em> raw representation (even using base graphics).</li>
<li>You <em>know</em> this is going to be periodically done, so you shift to functions, you parametrize some things.</li>
<li>Now you have x = f(…), y = g(…), and z(…).</li>
<li>You are happy because you still can do something like f(…) + g(…) + z(….).</li>
<li>You realize your functions depend on global parameters like the date in which you do each of your experiments.</li>
<li>You decide you are going to take this a step forward, here comes <code>list.files</code> and <code>lapply()</code> to save the day.</li>
<li>You wrap your main functions inside other functions that are compatible with lists (because now EVERYTHING is a list).</li>
<li>You realize that you lost.</li>
<li>You add checkpoints, questions, exceptions (for all those moments where data behave as well…normal messy data).</li>
<li>Your code has grown so much you have no clue what it does unless you run the full script, so now it looks like wrapper of wrapper x + wrapper of wrapper y + wrapper of wrapper z -&gt; entangled results.</li>
<li>You are so happy that you can run all those files like a charm (and it works!) so you acquire a shit ton of data.</li>
<li>You didn’t optimize for “a shit ton of data”, your code is slow now. Also…what were you thinking? You don’t need those 17 extra plots in between calculations. You have no time to look at them now that you are running hundreds of tiny files as inputs.</li>
<li>Calculations take forever now. You realize that you had to save intermediate steps.</li>
<li>Even if you tried saving them, most of your functions are dependent on other tiny values (dates, number of trials, number of rows of matrix named “WHATEVER”).</li>
<li>Make your own R package.</li>

  <title>About Good Discussions</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>Arguing may likely be an intrinsic feature of our species, maybe our competitive edge, or even a paramount example of our Human Nature<sup>1</sup>. Part of my decision to work in Science is because of the continuous exchange of ideas generated through formal argumentation. By formal argumentation I mean the translation of the basic principles that govern how the Universe functions into a language we can understand and share (hopefully agree upon?). But I also enjoy argumentation outside the scientific environment. For example, I deeply enjoy books on negotiation<sup>2</sup> and having hypothetical conversations in agreement/disagreement with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/samharrisorg">Sam Harris</a> or <a href="https://tim.blog/">Tim Ferris</a>.</p>
<p>I devote some time to think about discussions and debate myself about the existence of general principles that can be extracted. Such principles should <em>work</em> regardless of the context in which the discussion is happening (e.g, professional, teaching, personal).</p>
<p>I have been baking some ideas, which I try to apply to the way I work with people and teach. Some of my thinking is below:</p>
<section id="what-makes-a-good-discussion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-makes-a-good-discussion">What makes a good discussion?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Exchange of ideas.</strong> This is more than a fundatamental principle of arguments, it is mandatory for any communication that has more than one direction of flow. <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex">Matt Ridley</a> has made an interesting point about what are the best contexts in which this exchange happens for scientific endeavors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Defining the space of the discussion.</strong> I detest the philosophical debate about definitions, particularly when it prevents from getting to the actual discussion. Burrying a debate in semantics is one of my greatest fears. But Philosophers understand that there is no point in trying to debate about something if we do not agree about <em>what that something is</em>. Additionally, for a discussion to be meaningful, we should agree on the terms in which we evaluate evidence and thus are allowed to make valid claims. If and only if we agree on the axioms that serve as building blocks for argumentation we might have a proper space to elaborate reasons and viewpoints (from Marvel vs DC to the Meaning of Life).</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="what-makes-a-bad-discussion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-makes-a-bad-discussion">What makes a bad discussion?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The agree to disagree mentality.</strong> This exit is somewhat primitive. It shuts conversation, it stalls argumentation at a basic level. The goal of coming to an agreement is always secondary to the fact that we are exchanging ideas. The danger of this phrase is that it hides what the real problem is (the subject matter of discussion) and shifts it towards the person you are disagreeing with (e.g., because you are not smart/patient/calm/whatever enough to get this, I am no longer talking with you). Passive aggressiveness is not a constructive way to get to a disagreement. It is true that, given genuine disagreement, the real conclusion of a discussion will sound much like this phrase. However, taking this exit prematurely makes both parts end up losing, and feeling as if it the endeavour was a waste of time, while getting at the genuine point in which we disagree and understanding why we do so can be enlightening.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>This is not an exchange, it’s a competition.</strong> The goal of a discussion should not be to win the argument. It is not a battle, it is an exchange of ideas. Given 1) I convince you that my way of thinking makes sense and 2) If and only if my rationale is correct; Then we <strong>both win</strong>. Otherwise, it’s a zero-sum game, or even worse, we all lose.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Winner takes all mentality.</strong> This one is very related to the previous one, but it is more dangerous. Even with a winning mentality, whoever wins does not need to be crowned master and owner of all. We need not argue <em>against</em> an opponent nor we need to completely destroy our interlocutor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You can talk but I’m not listening.</strong> Listening does not mean that you have to agree with what it is being said. But it does mean that you are open to considering whatever argument is offered to you as valid, or even true, as long as it is sound. You need a certain mindset to be listening and actively evaluating the arguments presented. You need to be somehow outside of yourself. If any or both parts are so self-centered they cannot listen, there is no discussion. Why? Because it is not possible to have a proper exchange of ideas by taking turns in vomiting a set of words into each another. At that point, it is no longer a discussion, it shifts towards being <em>personal</em>, no longer the idea itself.</p></li>

<section id="life-without-purpose" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="life-without-purpose">Life without purpose</h2>
<p>Living without a purpose is something I am unable to do. I am into the <em>rules of the game</em>, the idea that there’s a goal, and we are trying to achieve something, do something, create an object or service that was not there before and now fulfills a function. There are few games that I play for the sake of keep playing like the learning game. But, more often than not, I stand on the side of finite games. Still, when I compare myself with the average student in the United States (US), I feel I know nothing about finite games. Their whole Universe cycles around winning, knowing how to follow the rules, hack the multiple choice, get the job done, keep the eyes on the prize, <em>[fill here yet another catchy phrase]</em>.</p>
<p>These young individuals come to University being highly driven and stumble upon a wall of requirements and unclear bureaucratic norms. They are expected to sit quietly and go through several courses that have little purpose. They shuttle between irrelevant numbing experiences and crucial content, delivered in mini-lectures (attention spans are shortening), that only happen in the classes that actually matter (supposedly those that offer 3 or 4 credits). Everything else is hiding under a mystic cloud. Most of my students complain about classes being vague, unstructured, pointless. I thought they would also complain about the amount of money that goes into acquiring these <em>credits</em> but they are still willing to allow the system to borrow from their pocket. It seems to me that they have been indoctrinated, well done high-school!</p>
<p>What am I talking about? Maybe a couple of examples could help. Some of the things that are currently being taught in US higher education.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you make a friend?</li>
<li>How do you detect and respond to a <em>microagression</em>?</li>
<li>Where is the Campus Center?</li>
<li>How to watch television?</li>
<li>How to climb a tree?</li>
</ul>
<p>When I say being taught, I mean this is actual class content and students are graded on their answers to these questions. Don’t get me wrong, I am not making any judgement on the value about how important this information is. I would suggest that knowing to make friends is one of the most fundamental traits any <em>Homo Sapiens</em> should have. My question lives at another level. I wonder about higher education requirements and whether this content is something that needs to be taught in formal education or not. I wonder about the training the next generation of builders, writers, and creatives receives. We ask them to ‘Answer with an opinion’, ‘React to a class’ or ‘React to a reaction’. We give them points for breathing, as long as it is inside the classroom. If they want to breathe outside, they better have a piece of paper signed by an authority for the next class.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-do-i-have-to-do-with-this">What do I have to do with this?</h2>
<p>As a grad student, you don’t always get to choose who is paying your rent. I talk with my brain quite often, theoretical experiment ahead (pun intended):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Brain</strong>: How much would you need to be paid to do XYZ?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: XYZ? Pff…..a lot, I cannot even tell you how much…<br>
<strong>Brain</strong>: I can tell you how much, your stipend it’s coming from teaching XYZ class next semester.<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: What!?<br>
<strong>Brain</strong>: Yes, you’ve guessed…welcome to grad school.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I have to teach these classes, I cannot help but wonder: why are we doing this? what is the purpose?</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-the-purpose-of-higher-education" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-the-purpose-of-higher-education">What is the purpose of higher education?</h2>
<p>I believe this question has no general answer. I find myself unsatisfied by the attempts to encapsulate higher education, particularly facing the fact that somewhere during this century human performance will be out-passed by computer’s performance in the vast majority of tasks. I host a mix of hope and fear about that, but I am somewhat confident in the fact that it will happen.</p>
<p>Whatever answer we go for, it is going to be highly dependent on the field. It will not be the same if you are doing Physics or Business. The lens through which you see the world, your daily mental framework, is going to be different. Yet, it appears to me that, from Public Policy perspective, we should find overlapping opinions. To a certain extent, this is such a fundamental issue that we cannot afford to have it diverge in the way it is diverging now. It not only affects the training students receive from an academic perspective, it <strong>devaluates the degree</strong> on the job market. Could we find a set of experiences and abilities (professional or personal) that we agree upon?</p>
</section>
<section id="mix-and-match" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mix-and-match">Mix and Match</h2>
<p>Arguments towards diversification of higher education are everywhere, should we aim towards teaching the so called <em>well-rounded</em> individuals <sup>1</sup>? I believe the borders dividing areas are blurry but they do exist. In that blurry interface, I believe there’s a huge potential to win from interdisciplinary work. Moreover, I would venture to say that many of the groundbreaking work will only be possible due to interdisciplinary team efforts. I still debate myself about what is the correct mix and match for the optimal results. I will have a tentative, not extensive but forever updating, list below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineers using bio-mimicry to improve train design <sup>2</sup>.</li>
</ul>

  <title>How do you make a cake?</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 






<p>This post is inspired by my brief experience with the education system in the United States (US) and the way some students approach learning. I do not know what it is. Maybe it has to do with the tsunami of multiple-choice exams they have to go through, or the endless preparation for another standardized test on the horizon, or the glorification of the <em>take-home message</em> culture.</p>
<p>I wrote a question for an assignment that was pointing towards mechanisms at the level of the synapse that could result in drug tolerance. The question went something like</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What is the mechanism of action of XYZ at the synapse and how is it related to tolerance?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All students had one week to write answers and submit. One student came to talk right after class finished and asked for clarification on the question. The student was confused about what would the expected answer be. As you can see, it is not possible to answer the question by guessing between <em>quite wrong</em> and <em>less wrong</em> options; you have to know what XYZ does and some bits and pieces that make up synapses. Finally, you have to write something coherent.</p>
<p>If I was given this question, my first impulse is to go to Google. The original question was a bit more general, so I will not search for a particular drug. Let’s google:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://matiasandina.netlify.app/posts/2017-11-14-how-to-make-a-cake/Google_Tolerance_Mechanisms.JPG" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This experience gets you towards a good number of resources, some of my favorite are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance">Wikipedia</a></li>
<li><a href="http://neurowiki2013.wikidot.com/individual:tolerance">Neurowiki</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both of which have enough material to answer the question. I also want to make a honorable mention to Google Images, there’s plenty cartoon synapses and cascades there.</p>
<p>But my experience went a little different. The student was looking for a magic word that would solve the problem. She was looking for naming nodes and not for explaining mechanisms. Actually, it didn’t take long to realize that the student was actually not sure about what a mechanism was.</p>
<section id="how-do-you-make-a-cake" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-do-you-make-a-cake">How do you make a cake?</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Me: How do you make a cake?<br>
Student: You take the list of ingredients and put them in the oven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was not the answer I was looking for. At that moment, I realized how important was for me to receive the kind of education I received. I was taught to look for processes, not to rush for the answer. But the underlying idea of <em>a sequence of steps</em> had to be there, so I looked for it and it appeared:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Me: So…you take the piece of paper, with the list of ingredients and you bake it?<br>
Student: No…(rolls eyes, explains better)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How could it be possible? The student knew what we were talking about and had understanding about the fact that there is a the sequence of events causally interconnected. However, making the same connection for the assignment question did not come as easy. This was a good student, my concern started growing. In other words, I had failed in writing the exercise in terms that were easy to relate, the question was vague and did not point towards a clear path to answer it.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-wave-of-uncooked-cakes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-wave-of-uncooked-cakes">A wave of uncooked cakes</h2>
<p>The truth is that, when the assignments came back, most of the students failed to recognize what the question was aiming towards. Many used phrases like “Dopamine is a mechanism” or “Dopamine receptor is a mechanism”. So we went along and tried to cook <a href="https://addapinch.com/the-best-chocolate-cake-recipe-ever/">the best chocoloate cake {ever}</a>. I believe this exercise was good for working from the concrete up, into more abstract, general ideas of what a mechanism is.</p>
<p>I assume most of the fault about the wording, but I cannot disregard completely students’ responsibility. My guess is that part of this issue had to do with the way some students approach the exercises. They are looking for the quickest way to solve it, normally a noun to name a node of the network. <em>Flour</em> is an ingredient of cakes, but yelling it to my face does not help me understand how to make one. The question is about <em>how</em> flour gets modified into cake. The question needs you to tell me the story of the ingredients and how they become related to one another.</p>
<p>These things don’t come naturally, they are acquired through a lifetime of thinking and rethinking. What concerns me the most are the general education they received; what are the relevant predictors of success in learning? what are the ways to acquire and consolidate knowledge they have been taught? Maybe that’s why there was a mismatch after all.</p>
