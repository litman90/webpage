    "section": "Personal questions",
    "text": "Personal questions\nThe “how did you choose to be a neuroscientist” question was quite popular. It came in all these forms:\n\nHow did your professional career begin?\nWhat was your motivation for studying this career?\nWhat made you decide you wanted to be a neuroscientist?\nWhat was your inspiration to study that exact part of the body? Why not other?\nHow did you decide Neuroscience was your passion? And what things made you decide this career?\nWhat inspired you to choose this career?\nWhat led you to study this career?\nWhen did you start to have an interest in this career and why?\n\nThe answer is:\nI just felt really curious about how the natural world works. I could see beauty in Math and later in Chemistry, and wanted to learn more. Living things are by far the most complex systems we know of, so I was totally down for the challenge of figuring out how they work.\nHow many years did you study?\nI can tell you how many years I’ve been in school. Elementary school was 7, middle/high-school was 5, then university added another 5-6 years, 2 years for my Master’s of Science degree. School is just the beginning.\nHow young where you when you decided to study your major?\nI was 17. In Argentina you chose your “major” in the last year of high school. I chose Biology. Then, 3 years into the career, I chose neuroscience specifically (I was probably 21-22), to specialize in for 2-3 more years.\nWhat would you have studied if it was not neuroscience? // What do you think would have been of yourself if you had studied something else?\nProbably Chemistry or Engineering. If I could go back in time, I would tell myself to study Physics or Computer Science.\nWas neuroscience always your passion, or did you want to study something else?\nI started with biology but rather quickly wanted to study the brain specifically.\nWhat ability do you think separates humans from other animal species?\nSo far that we know, humans are aware (see below) and can communicate that quite clearly. Humans can also build upon knowledge of previous generations.\nWhat is the hardest topic or part to understand about Neuroscience?\nNeuroscience is full of hard, really hard, problems. I would have to say the most difficult is consciousness. How are we aware of being aware? How is it that we distinguish ourselves as an I that exists and has a will? Where is that voice in your head coming from? I wrote a short story about it, I might publish it some day :).\nWhat is the part that isn’t too important of the brain?\nI would have to say that you need 100% of your brain to function the way you do. I am not quite eager of losing any part of my brain, all of them are too important.\nWhat is the difference between brain neurons and normal neurons?\nI am a bit confused about the term normal neurons. There are neurons in the brain, neurons in the spinal cord and in our digestive tract. The basic principles of all neurons are the same, but, even in the brain, they differ in shape and physiological properties. Here’s a drawing from Cajal showing different neurons in the human cortex.\n\nDoes your family feel good with what are you studying or they wanted you to study another thing?\nMy family was always supportive. As usual, a career in science looks difficult and it might seem like it’s quite tough to get a job, so there were some doubts, but nonetheless my family was supportive.\nWhy do we sometimes forget the words we were going to say at the time?\nThis is a great question. I don’t have a clue! Please, if you find out, let me know!\nWhy is your research important?\nIt’s quite difficult to pinpoint why any experiment is important. But we can think about knowledge as a circle, and questions as a frontier to the outside (the unknown). The more we study and answer questions, the more the circle grows. The larger the circle, the more things the scientific field can improve our lives. Interestingly, the more the circle grows, the larger the frontier, meaning we have more questions to answer1!\nHave you learned any lesson from your years of work that you can apply in your daily life? // Does this job affect your personal life in any way?\nYes, see below.\nWhat event in your life as a neuroscientist marked you in your personal life and why?\nBeing a scientist involves dealing with information about the world. A fact is a fact. Now, there are different ways of making sense of that fact, and the way scientists do it is by building models (creating a hypothesis) and making predictions. Scientists should always start by trying to prove themselves wrong. Only when they failed to prove themselves wrong, they tend to accept a version of the world (the one that better fits that fact).\nPresented with an observation people tend to go with intuitive explanations of why it happened. Normally, that intuitive is close to whatever that person has at hand, whatever personal experience they have (we call this reasoning by induction, which is quite useful and intuitive, but often fails). Scientific training should aim to teach to think in counterintuitive ways.\nFor example:\n\n\n\nWhite swan (Cygnus olor)\n\n\n\nObservation 1: I see a white swan.\nObservation 2: I have never seen a black swan.\n\nIt is tempting to conclude that black swans do not exist. And the whole world thought that way until they went to Australia and New Zeland and found a black one!\n\n\n\nBlack swan (Cygnus atratus)\n\n\nThe bottom line is, being a scientist teaches you to approach facts by questioning your intuition and making testable arguments. Do not belive whatever is writen, no mater where it is writen, judge the content, hold it to the highest standard.\nDo you think that later on, when neuroscience is more advanced, there could exist the cure to neurological diseases?\nWhen nuroscience advances more, we will find more cures or treatments. There will be no unique cure, because there is no unique neurological disease.\nWhy is it that when you read the words that describe an experience, you can sometimes, perfectly imagine the situation?\nThat is a great question. I was recently discussing this with other neuroscientists. The truth is that we do not know. But our mind is perfectly capable of creating images (when you sleep yo can see even though your eyes are closed!). The mind is quite powerful at doing this. Try the following task. If you want to be scientific about it, you can time yourself!\n\nTrial 1: As fast as you can, read out loud the word sequence.\nTrial 2: As fast as you can, name out loud the color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat task was more difficult? You can see how powerful the interference of reading is. It’s quite difficult to name the color when the word clearly says another thing! This is called Stroop Effect\nWhat was the most difficult subject while studying to become a neuroscientist?\nPhysics has some concepts that are difficult to grasp like Optics, Thermodynamics and Electromagnetism.\nHow are memories stored and retrieved?\nThat’s one of the best questions I ever had. Actually, that was one of the questions that lead me to study neuroscience in the first place. Although there are certain hypothesis, we know little about how it is done. You can start here. If you want to know more scientific detail, hit me up and I will send you a bunch of papers :)\nAre you happy or satisfied with what you’ve attained in your life so far?\nWow this is getting to the hard stuff! I would say I have come a long way but there’s definitely room for improvement and new challenges to tackle.\nWhat goals are you looking forward to achieve in your career as a neuroscientist?\nI would like to be able to keep doing research in science. Hopefully be able to contribute to a better understanding of disase and treatment.\nWhat is the most difficult part of being a neuroscientist? // What is the hardest part of your carreer?\nDealing with failure. We must be perseverant and smart about pivoting directions when we fail.\nDo you have seen something that does not have any explication about animal behavior? // Have you ever had a situation in which you don’t know the solution to in your career?\nEvery day, all day, all the time! No, seriously, we need help trying to figure animal behavior, please come help us!\nWhat’s your biggest inspiration to do science? // What is the thing you like most about it?\nIt’s beautiful. The feeling of understanding something deep about our Universe is quite rewarding.\nHow did studying in MIT help develop more your career?\nI got to work with nice people and do a bunch of cool science. That will get the research published (hopefully soon!) and it will allow me to continue my career as a scientist.\nWhat tips can you give for those people that what to study neuroscience?\nPerseverance, we all fail, push forward. Find a team and contribute to that team with the best you can. Other people have given better advice than me here. It’s long but I highly recommend it.\nWould you consider the outdoor activities you practice important for any scientific or personal development?\nYes, running, playing sports, dancing, and any outdoor/physical activities are crucial to physical well-being and mental health.\nHow can animals feel pain?\nWe animals have pain receptors that comunicate the sensation of pain. See more info here.\n\nWhat is the process you most use when researching animal behavior?\nI would say looking at the animals with my eyes. Everything else is a way to quantify and modify the intuition I get from looking at the animals.\nDo animals can have the same diseases as humans?\nSome diseases affect all animals, some diseases affect some animals, some are human-specific (for example HIV - AIDS).\nDoes this work involve more physiology or biochemistry?\nIt involves everything. Everything you learn can be useful (even if it’s not scientific per se).\nCan you explain the difference between MRI and CT scans?\nBoth techniques can be used to image tissue. The main difference is that one uses X-rays (CT scan) and the other uses magnetic fields and radiowaves to do it (MRI)\nWhat would happen if a kid is born without a developed central nervous system and how you will solve it?\nIt probably depends on the type of underdevelopment. Unfortunately, I would not be able to solve it (I do not work with clinical patients, I work with animals in basic research).\nWhat is the behavior of cockroaches after being irriated with co-60?\nI have no idea. After googling co-60, that is cobalt 60, I found out it is actually a radioactive form of cobalt. My question is: how much co-60 are we talking about? Anyway, that experiment has been done, in a paper called Some Early Effects of Ionizing Radiation on the German Cockroach,Blattella germanica. Authors concluded that radiation destroys reproductive organs and produces death. I don’t think behavior was affected but definitely lifespan was.\nHave you ever been scared of working with a specific animal? // Is it complicated being Neuroscientist and interacting with a certain species?\nYes, working with animals is a little bit challenging. Rodents are, in general, much easier to work with than other animals. Some animals are more scary to work with (owls, bats, monkeys, pigs). Wild animals are probably really hard to work with.\nWhat made you interact with animals instead of humans? // Why did you wanted to study animal behavior instead of human behavior? // Why did you choose to be a neuroscientist that focused on animals?\nI’m most interested in interventions. We can’t open human brains to see what’s going on.\nHow difficult and compromising is to choose neuroscience as a future career?\nIt definitely involves commitment. And commitment alone will not get you very far. You can be very committed and still not get good things out of it. Do not underestimate your network and pure luck!\nHow has working with animals improved your knowledge about human behavior?\nIt has given me the possibility to test ideas about human behavior on animal models.\nWhat has been the most difficult species of animal that you have worked with?\nAll species have their perks and difficulties. I wouldn’t be able to tell.\nHow do you understand the behavior of animals?\nWe normally try to condense behavior into variables that we can measure. That help us build theories we can test with more experiments.\nWhat is the dominant mammalian animal species used in a neuroscience research?\nBy dominant I pressume you mean frequent. It’s probably mice (mus musculus).\nDo you ever get intimidated by others in your same career?\nOf course, unfortunately, science is not devoid of hierarchical structures and people at the top can be scary sometimes.\nWhat type of breakfast do you have every morning?\nI have either a toast with cream cheese or an omlette. Some fruit maybe, banana milkshake if I’m feeling like it’s a special day. Tea always.\nHow hard did you work to have this job?\nNot like REALLY REALLY hard. Coal miners have it way worse than me, and they have to work in a harmful environment (for a lot less pay!). That being said, I feel that I have had to put effort into it, it was not automatic.\nIs it true that if humans eat other humans their brains get damaged and if it is true why it only affects humans?\nYes, if they it other human brains and those brains have something called prions, it can happen. It’s not specific to humans, see Bovine spongiform encephalopathy.\nHow you compare your work with your social life? // Do you have extra time for your family and other business? // How do you manage to balance your work and your social life?\nDuring the week, work comes first. During the weekend, social life comes first. About the “other business”, I’m not sure, do you have an offer I can’t refuse?\nAre there any animal models of self-mutilation?\nI have not come across any during my experience, but other people definitely have something to say about it, see here.\nWhat is something you always wanted to do that you have not done it yet and why?\nI have visited many places in the World. I still would like to travel more.\nEven though humans are more envolved, do animals have a more complex brain?\nHumans are not more evolved2. Human brains are definitely more complex.\nWhat concepts of the study of animals you dislike the most?\nThe first thing I should note is that, regardless of how careful and caring we are, we won’t be able to do neuroscience without intervention on animals. These animals live confined and we often perform surgeries on them. That’s not awesome, but it’s\nBeyond that, I would say I don’t like the fact that we can’t talk to them. They can’t express how they feel, what’s going on on their minds whenever we study them. We have to work around this, infer their mental state from other variables.\nHave you ever be surprised by an animal case with a mutation?\nWe work with mutants all the time. A mutation is not how you might see it pictured in movies. In fact, your own DNA is mutating all the time, for the rest of your life. That being said, there are certain mutations that produce very interesting effects (we call them phenotypes). Here’s the ob/ob mouse model:\n\n\n\nob/ob mouse on the left, normal mouse on the right\n\n\nThese animals can’t produce leptin, a hormone involved in energy balance and metabolism. They never experience a signal that tells them to stop eating (leptin) and hence they eat much more and gain a lot of weight."

    "text": "Arguing may likely be an intrinsic feature of our species, maybe our competitive edge, or even a paramount example of our Human Nature1. Part of my decision to work in Science is because of the continuous exchange of ideas generated through formal argumentation. By formal argumentation I mean the translation of the basic principles that govern how the Universe functions into a language we can understand and share (hopefully agree upon?). But I also enjoy argumentation outside the scientific environment. For example, I deeply enjoy books on negotiation2 and having hypothetical conversations in agreement/disagreement with Sam Harris or Tim Ferris.\nI devote some time to think about discussions and debate myself about the existence of general principles that can be extracted. Such principles should work regardless of the context in which the discussion is happening (e.g, professional, teaching, personal).\nI have been baking some ideas, which I try to apply to the way I work with people and teach.

This is more than a fundatamental principle of arguments, it is mandatory for any communication that has more than one direction of flow. Matt Ridley has made an interesting point about what are the best contexts in which this exchange happens for scientific endeavors.\nDefining the space of the discussion. I detest the philosophical debate about definitions, particularly when it prevents from getting to the actual discussion. Burrying a debate in semantics is one of my greatest fears. But Philosophers understand that there is no point in trying to debate about something if we do not agree about what that something is. Additionally, for a discussion to be meaningful, we should agree on the terms in which we evaluate evidence and thus are allowed to make valid claims. If and only if we agree on the axioms that serve as building blocks for argumentation we might have a proper space to elaborate reasons and viewpoints (from Marvel vs DC to the Meaning of Life)."

    "text": "What makes a bad discussion?\n\nThe agree to disagree mentality. This exit is somewhat primitive. It shuts conversation, it stalls argumentation at a basic level. The goal of coming to an agreement is always secondary to the fact that we are exchanging ideas. The danger of this phrase is that it hides what the real problem is (the subject matter of discussion) and shifts it towards the person you are disagreeing with (e.g., because you are not smart/patient/calm/whatever enough to get this, I am no longer talking with you). Passive aggressiveness is not a constructive way to get to a disagreement. It is true that, given genuine disagreement, the real conclusion of a discussion will sound much like this phrase. However, taking this exit prematurely makes both parts end up losing, and feeling as if it the endeavour was a waste of time, while getting at the genuine point in which we disagree and understanding why we do so can be enlightening.\nThis is not an exchange, it’s a competition. The goal of a discussion should not be to win the argument. It is not a battle, it is an exchange of ideas. Given 1) I convince you that my way of thinking makes sense and 2) If and only if my rationale is correct; Then we both win. Otherwise, it’s a zero-sum game, or even worse, we all lose.\nWinner takes all mentality. This one is very related to the previous one, but it is more dangerous. Even with a winning mentality, whoever wins does not need to be crowned master and owner of all. We need not argue against an opponent nor we need to completely destroy our interlocutor.\nYou can talk but I’m not listening. Listening does not mean that you have to agree with what it is being said. But it does mean that you are open to considering whatever argument is offered to you as valid, or even true, as long as it is sound. You need a certain mindset to be listening and actively evaluating the arguments presented. You need to be somehow outside of yourself. If any or both parts are so self-centered they cannot listen, there is no discussion. Why? Because it is not possible to have a proper exchange of ideas by taking turns in vomiting a set of words into each another. At that point, it is no longer a discussion, it shifts towards being personal, no longer the idea itself."

    "text": "¿Quién quiere repetir?\nLa permanencia de un senador – o de cualquier otro político – en el cargo es un tema de debate interesante. En primer lugar, uno esperaría que cualquier trabajador con experienca y conocimiento sobre su área sea más eficiente y productivo. En criollo, si me tengo que operar de apendicitis mañana, prefiero un médico que haya realizado 1350 cirugías de apéndice que uno que haya realizado 122. Luego, si trasladamos este razonamiento a nuestras instituciones deberíamos querer que el Senado esté compuesto de políticos con muchos años de experiencia en la cámara alta.\nEl problema radica en identificar cuáles son los puestos que se parecen al del médico haciendo la misma cirugía y aquellos que no. Tomemos el ejemplo de los burócratas del Estado de carrera, los estadístas, los responsables de mantenimiento de infraestructura. Esta es la gente que hace funcionar el aparato, sin ellos, no hay implementación, no hay político que pueda hacer nada. Una cosa podría que identificarlos es que todos ellos deberían ser apolíticos y, como tales, deberían poder cumplir su labor siendo independientes del gobierno de turno3. Los investigadores del CONICET y los maestros también son buenos ejemplos de este tipo de empleados de Estado4.\nEn cambio, el rol de los integrantes del Poder Legislativo está contaminado por el hecho de que, entre otras cosas:\n\nLegislan su propio salario.\nTienen la postestad de regular actividades económicas de manera conveniente.\nTienen re-elección indefinida.\n\nPor supuesto, podemos sumar el cúmulo de beneficios legales (como canjear viáticos por dinero en efectivo y discresionalidad de presupuesto) y aquellos no legales (en criollo, corrupción). Pero éste no es el lugar para analizar eso, focalicemos en los períodos. Los datos mandan, así que veamos qué es lo que dicen. Históricamente, la gran mayoría de senadores no repite su cargo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepetidores por su nombre\nEste fenómeno puede explicarse por múltiples causas. Antes de cualquier análsis, veamos quiénes son los repetidores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcá vemos por primera vez algunos nombres que suenan más a calle o a localidad que a lo que hicieron. Pero también vemos algunos nombres bastante familiares y actuales. Recordemos que 4 o 5 mandatos son, según la duración de mandato actual, entre 24 y 30 años en el mismo puesto!\n\n\nMáximos reemplazantes\nUna curiosidad ingenua me llevó a preguntarme cuáles son los máximos reemplaznates. Me pregunté si, quizás, existía una caja con senadores de repuesto que pudieran cumplir los roles una vez que la figurita política de turno lograba conseguir los votos.\nEn otras palabras: ¿Es posible que exista un grupo de senadores comodín? Los datos presentan una triste realidad, una en la que la historia del Poder Legislativo Argentino está contaminada por sucesivas disoluciones. Llamémosles por su nombre, Golpes de Estado. Aún así, hay algunos senadores que han tomado la posta como suplente en reiteradas ocasiones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReemplazante\nNúmero de veces\n\n\n\n\nDISOLUCION DEL P.

Por eso, ordené a los senadores según el número de días que estuvieron (o aún están). Esta herramienta es simplemente para facilitar la visualización de los casos más extremos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSólo dos ejemplos, el resto de tarea:\nVidal fue gobernador de la provincia de Corrientes (dos veces), diputado, senador por 32 años (literalmente hasta su muerte, a los 80 años). Mendoza fue legislador provincial, diputado, gobernador de San Luis y luego senador por 27 años.\nIndependientemente de lo grandiosas o nefastas de sus contribuciones y el servicio a su País, queda claro que la carrera política les permitió perpetuarse de formas que no sólo son imposibles en la mayoría de otros gremios, sino que son mucho más peligrosas para la Nación.\nUna cosa que resulta interesante es que pareciera que existen dos tipos de senadoes. Existe un quiebre entre aquellos que se quedan 1 o 2 mandatos y los demás, que se perpetúan en el cargo al mejor estilo Julio Grondona (#TodoPasa).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEs interesante que en ningún momento busqué los 10 años como punto de quiebre, este valor surgió de hacer una simple regresión partida. Podemos ver que los casos más extremos se desvían bastante de la regresión (sugiriendo un incremento aún más fuerte que uno lineal), pero me pareció una forma de simplificar el asunto: más de dos mandatos y estás para quedarte, no por un rato, para quedarte a vivir."

Vale recalcar que dos mandatos de 9 años te colocan muy arriba en el el ránking, mientras que necesitarías 3 mandatos completos con la nueva longitud de 6 años para llegar a la misma cantidad. Es fácil ver que, entre 1850 y 1930, existieron períodos con ciertos senadores ocupando las bancas de manera prolongada. Sin embargo, estamos hablando de un período político en donde ni siquiera se había legislado la Ley Saenz Peña o recién se había implementado. Ver tanto abuso no es sorprendente si el proceso es fundamentalmente anti-democrático y los períodos son tan largos.\nDesde el último retorno a la democracia, un número importante de senadores se han perpetuado de manera impresionante, incluso integrando más de un partido político (ver también el color de la camiseta)."

Al menos en mi mente, el funcionamiento interno de ciertas dependencias del Estado debe ser autónomo. Un dato es un dato (sea la masa de un átomo o el desempleo), un docente o un estadísta del INDEC no deberían estar afectados en su labor por el partido de turno.↩︎\nIncluso en estas circunstancias, no considero que los investigadores o los maestros deban estar haciendo siempre la misma tarea. Al contrario, sendos gremios deberían funcionar con una estructura que permita aprovechar la experiencia para el mejor funcionamiento en vez de promover una jerarquía absurda por la jerarquía misma. Una científica jóven quizás esté mejor capacitada para hacer experimentos con sus propias manos. Un maestro jóven para interactuar con alumnos sin que haya un salto generacional muy pronunciado.

Maybe it has to do with the tsunami of multiple-choice exams they have to go through, or the endless preparation for another standardized test on the horizon, or the glorification of the take-home message culture.\nI wrote a question for an assignment that was pointing towards mechanisms at the level of the synapse that could result in drug tolerance. The question went something like\nAll students had one week to write answers and submit. One student came to talk right after class finished and asked for clarification on the question. The student was confused about what would the expected answer be. As you can see, it is not possible to answer the question by guessing between quite wrong and less wrong options; you have to know what XYZ does and some bits and pieces that make up synapses. Finally, you have to write something coherent.\nIf I was given this question, my first impulse is to go to Google. The original question was a bit more general, so I will not search for a particular drug. Let’s google:\nThis experience gets you towards a good number of resources, some of my favorite are:\nBoth of which have enough material to answer the question. I also want to make a honorable mention to Google Images, there’s plenty cartoon synapses and cascades there.\nBut my experience went a little different. The student was looking for a magic word that would solve the problem. She was looking for naming nodes and not for explaining mechanisms. Actually, it didn’t take long to realize that the student was actually not sure about what a mechanism was."

I believe this exercise was good for working from the concrete up, into more abstract, general ideas of what a mechanism is.\nI assume most of the fault about the wording, but I cannot disregard completely students’ responsibility. My guess is that part of this issue had to do with the way some students approach the exercises. They are looking for the quickest way to solve it, normally a noun to name a node of the network. Flour is an ingredient of cakes, but yelling it to my face does not help me understand how to make one. The question is about how flour gets modified into cake. The question needs you to tell me the story of the ingredients and how they become related to one another.\nThese things don’t come naturally, they are acquired through a lifetime of thinking and rethinking. What concerns me the most are the general education they received; what are the relevant predictors of success in learning? what are the ways to acquire and consolidate knowledge they have been taught? Maybe that’s why there was a mismatch after all."

I host a mix of hope and fear about that, but I am somewhat confident in the fact that it will happen.\nWhatever answer we go for, it is going to be highly dependent on the field. It will not be the same if you are doing Physics or Business. The lens through which you see the world, your daily mental framework, is going to be different. Yet, it appears to me that, from Public Policy perspective, we should find overlapping opinions. To a certain extent, this is such a fundamental issue that we cannot afford to have it diverge in the way it is diverging now. It not only affects the training students receive from an academic perspective, it devaluates the degree on the job market. Could we find a set of experiences and abilities (professional or personal) that we agree upon?"

This post is about something completely out of their control: their birth dates. Yes, it sounds crazy, but the month of birth plays a huge role in the success of a football player.\nFootball schools around the world are normally organized around the calendar year. It makes sense, if you are going to make a tournament for kids, instead of having kids of different ages competing together, you grab all the kids born on a same year and make them play against each other (5 year-old kids vs other 5 year-old kids). For example, when I was playing these tournaments, I played in the 1991 category.\nScouts and coaches might decide to promote a strong/talented kid. In my case, I could play for the 1990 or 1989 categories. But we all agree that it would be unfair to downgrade me to play for the 1995 category. I would have a huge developmental advantage. So far so good, but there’s something that escapes from everyone: one year is a lot of time. The developmental difference between a 5 year old kid born at the beginning of the year (e.g, January 1st) vs one at the very end (e.g, December 31st) is huge.\nLet’s take a less extreme case, kids born with a 180 days difference. That amount of days corresponds to an extra fraction of life lived (aka experience, aka time kicking the ball) of 0.1. It might sound like very little but that 10% advantage will definitely compound over the competitive career."

    "text": "Logic behind\nIt turns out to be that scouts and coaches think they are selecting the best, but they are selecting the oldest. The January 1st cutoff is arbitrary and favors those born close to the date, who will be slightly stronger/faster/better only because they have had more time to play around in the world and, basically, grow. If you look closely, the only country that does not follow the pattern is the UK. But, yes, you guessed it, the cutoff date for the UK is August 31st.\nPlayers that are selected as the best normally play in the starting team and stay in the field more minutes each game [Experience based, Citation needed]. They get better training and more opportunities to play, either because they play more or because coaches pay more attention to them. Each extra minute reinforces the small initial difference, creating a real one. Of course, talent and effort play a role. But it consistently turns out to be that players born earlier on the calendar year end up being better than the other players. This phenomenon is known as relative age effect 2.\nWhenever we see skewed age distributions we should suspect it is likely due to arbitrary cuts. The magic ingredients go like this:\n\nMake an arbitrary cut.\nSelect those that are a tad ahead, those closest to the cut (older people relative to cut).\nDifferentiate training experience by giving more opportunities to those already ahead.\nHarvest the best players (older people relative to cut).\n\nThis is difficult to detect because it’s a self-fulfilled profecy for scouts (after all, they want their picks to end up being good). Basketball doesn’t have this kind of problem, mostly because availability of opportunities to train and the absence of strict cutoff dates. But in other sports, this effect is even more marked. In ice hockey, you are mostly constrained to the winter season to play and you need a rink, which puts more barriers on training3."

Kids born near the cutoff perform better at school and go to better universities. I cannot stop thinking that I was somewhat fortunate in this account. Overall, school never felt like too difficult. But maybe it’s because I had had enough days on earth and was mature enough to grasp concepts. Maybe it’s not only that “Math and Science came easy to me and I liked them”. Maybe I was born at the correct moment and I wouldn’t be pursuing academic endeavors if I hadn’t been born around the cutoff date in my country (July 1st).\nDividing school kids by age is retrograde. I would like to see a continuous progress with no boundaries on dates. I would like to see no kid be made to wait because he isn’t old enough yet and, more importantly, I would like to see no hurrying kids through content because their age says so. I would like to see people moving through school at their own pace5. Maybe we should start looking at performance adjusted by age, it might be the antidote we are looking for."

This measure doesn’t have to go all the way until they are pro, but at least until kids are old enough, so that we keep below the 6-8 month difference. This will possibly increase the costs for everyone and makes logistics more difficult.

    "section": "Problems in mind",
    "text": "Problems in mind\n\nWhere do you live?\nCode files usually live in one folder, which is also a GitHub folder that you and your team commit/push to. So far, so good. But what do you do with the data to feed that monster pipeline of yours?\nI will assume that your concerns with data privacy are minor or you handled them accordingly (only private parties have access to the data).\nNow, you still have the problem of where to put this other folder, which is basically a size problem.\n\nSmall files can live with your data\n\nThis is the case for small and few text files of some thousand rows. Easy enough, you just go with your /repo-name/data/ and live happily ever after.\n\nMedium size files\n\nThese files are big enough to be a problem for hosting on GitHub. File formats start to be an issue here, images and video will not be easily accessible anywhere you take it.\nOptions: the cloud ☁️\nPros: It’s fluffy. Now, seriously, it’s good that your code can point to one place, download the stuff into local and use it. Every computer can do the same and there should be no problem. Because your sizes are not huge, you should be fine.\nCons: You need internet. No, internet it’s not everywhere all the time1. Internet is not in my cellphone on a second basement in a concrete building. Even with the fastest internet, it’s not trivial to setup your-favorite-cloud-service to allow access to the-sketchy-script-you-wrote2.\n\n\n\n\nOptions: Good old-fashioned external hard drive. 💾\nPros: This is a good one if your data size is in the Gb range and you don’t really need to share it with too many people.\nCons: Hard drives fail. Are you ready to lose your data? It starts to get really annoying when you have to do back-ups of your data and your data is big enough that you can’t use your computer’s hard drive (that’s why you chose an external hard drive in the first place). Should you have an external hard drive for the external hard drive? Are you planning to write the output of your code on those hard drives? Brace for impact.\n\n\n\nExternal hard-drives might have paths that change depending on which computer is connected to. This can easily be a path inferno. Moreover, some hard drives don’t work if you try to use them in different OS.\n\nLarge sizes\n\nI work with brains. Last time I checked, one mouse brain is ~2TB, n=1, just a few channels, not even the best resolution we can get.\nI think local/cloud servers are the only way to go here3. I don’t have a lot of experience with this, but I have suffered internet upload/download speed problems when I try to sync with my cloud back-ups or share image/video files with my team.\n\n\nPaths need to be absolute\nBecause your working directory is the folder where your code lives4, but your data folder lives elsewhere, you kind of need to use absolute paths all the time.\nI have only been able to fix this issue using functions that attempt to fix this when running the script.\n\nfix_working_environment &lt;- function(saved_path,\n                                    local_path){\n  # if the folder structure doesn't work as expected...\n  # this will explode \n  stringr::str_replace(saved_path,\n                       \"some_regular_expression\",\n                       local_path)\n}\n\nThis is particularly annoying when you have to run commands that involve calling things from console.\nLet’s call ImageJ from R.\n\nsystem(paste(\"/home/matias/Downloads/Fiji.app/ImageJ-linux64 --run\",\n             macro_to_run))\n\nThe moment somebody changes the Fiji folder, or tries to call ImageJ from another computer, that code brakes. I’m unaware of how to make sure these things bullet-proof, please enlighten me.\nLet’s call python from R. Wait, what version of python do you want? I rest my case.\n\n\nProcesses are identified by the files\nI have this problem quite often. It might be because my pipelines follow this logic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s quite difficult to escape the infinite list all files –&gt; apply function to all files –&gt; write computations into new files loop. I don’t really know what’s on the other side.\nThe main problem is that your previous, current, and next files always serve as identifiers and you need to carry over their absolute path (to be able to read them form your data folder). Whenever these paths get corrupted (or you change your computer) things stop working.\nThis problem might stem from the fact that I normally have to process experimental units through the pipeline. I have to do many things to an experimental unit and have many many experimental units composing the data for one pipeline. That’s when my inner voice goes:\n\nBut I would also like to have the possibility to run or re-run just one (or just a few experimental units).\n\nThe way I handle this is by leaving open the door to hand selection of files (aka interactive mode, not fun). However, interactive mode somewhat helps with the problem below.\n\n\nDon’t move my files\nPeople do stuff people normally do, like moving folders around…that’s BAD, REALLY BAD. It’s also quite difficult to communicate the need to keep the file structure without casting the magic spells of everything will break5.\nI don’t feel good with the level of dependency on file structure that my projects always end up having. Please enlighten me on this one too!\n\n\nDon’t rename my files\nDon’t rename my files, except when I do. That would be a better subtitle of this section. A great way of not dealing with multiple copies of the same files. For example, let’s say you applied a mask to an image and then cropped, and rotated it. How many files do you keep? What if your image size was 1 Gb?\nMy hack around this is to rename the files (this include the cases where I just want to move files to specific sub-folders). Because I rely so much on the file names, this renaming usually comes back to bite me. I just 🤷.\n\n\nOperating systems\nI’m writing this in 2019, I thought the OS problem was solved. Turns out it’s not solved at all and developers shy away from it more often than they should. I understand them, developing for every OS is a huge pain and requires you to constantly check in multiple machines (or have access to a teammate that breaks your code as soon as you push it)."

This function comes really handy for text replacement.\nWe are going to modify the function a bit, we add x as the string we pass for cleaning and we will remove the tags progressively.\nWe are ready to use our super cool function and clean the text! Not perfect, but gets us 90% of the way.\nLet’s see how emails from Quora changed with this new encoding:\n\n\n                                            from\n1        Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;\n2        Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;\n3        Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;\n4  Selección_de_Quora &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;\n5        Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;\n6        Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;\n7        Quora Digest &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;\n8  Selección_de_Quora &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;\n9  Selección_de_Quora &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;\n10 Selección_de_Quora &lt;digest-noreply@quora.com&gt;\n\n\nLet’s filter those from “Received” or “Sent” (in Spanish, “Recibidos” or “Enviado”).\nTo save you from reading a considerable amount of code, I will load the other accounts and modify them accordingly in the background. I will finally merge everything together. Just enjoy the kitten while the code is running in my machine."

Who receives emails from me?\nWhen do I get emails (mostly)?\nWhen should I do something about it (aka, reply)?\n\n\nWarning: We have to dance with parsing dates and times. I highly recommend being familiar with lubridate (for example, see https://rdrr.io/cran/lubridate/man/parse_date_time.html).\n\n\nMost frequent senders\nJust because I’m curious, let’s take a look at who are the all time senders!\n\n\n                    from   n\n1                  Quora 393\n2                 Maggie 316\n3                   Yair 216\n4                Luciano 173\n5                  Sarah 167\n6                  \"Bank 161\n7           \"Amazon.com\" 139\n8                Mariana 138\n9  pubchase@zappylab.com 131\n10            \"Mendeley\" 126\n\n\nIt’s cool to know that my lingering feeling (“wow…Quora just spams the hell out of me”) is supported by data. Other big spammers are, of course, the Bank and Amazon. People I work with and friends come high up too. Funny to see Mendeley and Pubchase on the top ten, it’s been a long journey of them sending me papers, thank you for that2.\n\n\nFrom me to you\nLet’s try to find the people I directly send the most emails to. I tend to send a lot of automatic reminders via email to myself so I removed me from the destination.\n\n\n       to   n\n1 Mariana 192\n2 Mariana 126\n3    Yair  86\n4 Mélanie  64\n5   Beata  59\n\n\nLooks like both my former advisers get most of my output (yes, same name first name, not related)."

As a general rule, you have to have all the variables that you want to use as separate columns (i.e, year, month, day, week_day, time, …). The lubridate package helps a lot, but it’s still quite an effort.\nWorking only with times of the day, regardless of date itself is problematic. Working with periods is difficult, so as.numeric(x, \"hour\") is a friend.\nHere’s a hint of how the date column in the original data actually looks like. This may or might not look the same way for you, it depends on your date settings.\n\n\n                             date\n1 Sat, 23 Mar 2019 08:57:48 -0700\n2 Sat, 23 Mar 2019 08:57:32 -0700\n3 Sat, 23 Mar 2019 20:25:31 -0400\n4 Sat, 23 Mar 2019 08:57:46 -0700\n5 Sat, 23 Mar 2019 08:57:35 -0700\n\n\nLet’s create all the variables we need.

    "text": "Birdseye\nLet’s look at how the whole email movement looks like. In the last couple of years, I clearly felt the load rising and rising. The lack of data in the early years is mostly due to me not downloading everything from the Hotmail account (it’s too late, too far in the past to fix :P). Besides, the trend likely holds quite well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we split by input and output, we can easily see that the input-output ratio went nuts when I moved to the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not really surprising, given the amount of unsolicited advertising I started getting since the move. Yes, I’m talking to you again Quora/Amazon/people trying to sell me stuff3. Of course, University related chains likely take a big chunk of the pie.\nI don’t feel like parsing out each sender out of the sheer amount. I have had the Gmail and Hotmail accounts for more than 10 years, but the University email is something relatively recent. All in all, considering the time I’ve had each account, the input rate coming from universities worries me. Here are the total email for each account:\n\n\n\n  Gmail hotmail     MIT   umass \n   7481   10331    1297    7122 \n\n\n\nWhen\nLet’s add the time of the day to the equation. This plot was made using ggbeeswarm package, I highly recommend checking it, it’s pure power. I got help to put the labels in the y axis from ‘00:00’ to ‘24:00’. You can find a toy example in this StackOverflow question.\n\n\nDaily news\nWhat’s the average number of emails per day? I’m including all the emails in from 2015 to 2019, including those that go directly to trash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those looking for some tabulated info, here it is:\n\n\n\nNumber of emails per day received in all accounts\n\n\nYear\nMean\nMin\nMax\nMode\n\n\n\n\n2015\n6.8\n1\n30\n3\n\n\n2016\n10.2\n1\n45\n2\n\n\n2017\n14.5\n1\n68\n2\n\n\n2018\n13.0\n1\n66\n6\n\n\n2019\n18.9\n1\n132\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nI am more inclined to graphics, the following figure shows not only an increasing mean, but, surprisingly, a widening range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll days were not created equal\nOf course, the number of emails somewhat depends on the day of the week. We can easily see a decreasing trend.\n\n\n\n Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri  Sat  Sun \n4720 4748 4469 4326 3928 1938 1970 \n\n\nAlthough the day of the week has influence on the amount of emails received, the time of the day seems to have a stronger, more permanent effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything together\nIf we pool all the data together, it seems that I receive/send emails at all times, although there is more movement in the accounts around 10:00 and 16:30. Overall, the distributions are quite similar4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust for fun\nJust for the fun of data visualization. Here’s the same plot but adding coord_polar to it. I believe it creates a very weird but good looking thing. It’s not really a clock but there’s something about it I can’t stop looking at5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit in two\nAs you can see from the figures above, the emails in the received bucket have two humps (wink, Bactrian camel, little prince), but I send emails at almost all times (except maybe between 2 AM and 5 AM). This is a bad habit, I should not be sending emails all the time, I should batch to diminish the costs associated with shifting tasks. I could just put a rule of thumb and check emails only once a day (e.g, 12:00:00). However, this might not be the best decision, because it chunks the response time in two very broad categories (either I get back to you somewhat quick, within 2 hours, or I take almost a full day to reply).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, checking emails only once might make me miss something somewhat fleeting. In general, I want to read things during the time they are relevant (did anybody say free pizza?).\nThe primary goal, then, is to minimize the times I check/send emails without 1) impacting my perceived response rate and 2) missing out too much info during the day. But that optimization problem is hard to solve and likely a waste of time (trust me, I tried and I’m not that smart).\nI believe we can solve it with a rule of thumb anyway. Let’s say, I would check emails twice a day and respond immediately, unless I need to harness some brain power to create an elaborate response6.\nI just wrote a “cost function” and calculated the cost for several combinations of times.\n\n\nShow the code\nvalues &lt;- emails %&gt;%\n  filter(simple_label==\"Received\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(val = as.numeric(seconds_to_period(my_time))) %&gt;%\n  pull(val)\n\n# calculate linear distance to minimize \n\ndist_to_min &lt;- function(values, possible_times){\n \n  min_time &lt;- min(possible_times)\n  max_time &lt;- max(possible_times)\n  # do nothing to first batch\n  corrected_values &lt;- ifelse(values &lt; max_time,\n                           values,\n  # shift the ones answered on next day, this already gives positive distance\n                          86400 - values + min_time)\n\n  \n  to_second &lt;- between(corrected_values, min_time, max_time)\n  second_batch &lt;- corrected_values[to_second]\n  first_batch &lt;- corrected_values[!to_second]  \n  \n  # Calculate distance (should be all positive)\n  dist_second &lt;- max_time - second_batch \n  \n  dist_first &lt;- ifelse(first_batch &lt; min_time,\n                       min_time - first_batch,\n                       corrected_values)\n\n  total_dist &lt;- sum(c(dist_first, dist_second))\n  \n  return(total_dist)\n}\n\n\nNow we can use our dist_to_min function in a loop. We’ll calculate from the first second of the day, to the last (86400) every half hour (1800 sec).\n\n\nShow the code\n# Create the data to iterate over\nval &lt;- seq(1, 86400, 1800)\nval &lt;- data.frame(t(combn(val,2)))\nnames(val) &lt;- c(\"Var1\", \"Var2\")\ndistance &lt;- numeric(length=nrow(val))\n\n# For loop...\nfor (i in 1:nrow(val)){\n  possible_times &lt;- val[i, ]\n  \n  distance[i] &lt;- dist_to_min(values, possible_times)\n  \n}\n\n\nThe function calculates the distance we want to minimize. The output looks like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSounds like the combinations we care about are those below 2.5e+8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this long post is to say that, from now on, I will be answering my emails in either one of these combinations.\n\n\n  first_batch second_batch\n1   12H 0M 1S    18H 0M 1S\n2   11H 0M 1S   17H 30M 1S\n\n\n\n\nA finer grain\nJust for the fun of it, let’s take a closer look, a second by second analysis.

    "text": "Summary\nI have had a lot of fun doing this project. I also experienced an enormous amount of frustration with dates. Moreover, every time I thought this project was over, a new little idea for a not so little graph came into my mind. Of course, I went after it. I hope this info helps other people take a look at their own personal analytics and make some decisions. I am somewhat happy I have almost all notifications turned off (hence, no Facebook/Twitter/Slack/whatever appearing as top senders). In fact, turning email notifications off is the first thing I do when I sign up for a service/site, I encourage you to do the same.\nBatching is something I will start testing. I can’t control my input but, hopefully, the distributions of my sent email will start matching the times I designated. More importantly, people will not notice, even if the email input keeps increasing.\n\nSome people requested me to do the following scatter-plot. I went with the ggbeeswarm version on the text because I find it more appealing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI excluded parts of the code because it was too much. I am happy to share if requested!\n\nSources:\nhttps://jellis18.github.io/post/2018-01-17-mail-analysis/\nhttps://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/\nhttps://uc-r.github.io/kmeans_clustering"

    "text": "When do I move?\nI will start by focusing on the data for steps.\nI’m curious to see what times of the day have the most activity. Because I have a quite large amount of data points (~751 K) I will use geom_hex() to count for me and simplify rendering1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, I should have remembered that for the vast majority of minutes (regardless of the hour of the day), the count is exactly zero. Let’s only look at the positive counts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see now some patches that have high activity (&gt; 100 steps), particularly around 9:00, 12:00 and 18:00. These mostly correspond to “going to work”, “activity around lunch time (?)”, and “going home / physical activity”. For all other cases, it looks like I move around 10-20 steps per minute, regardless of the minute within the hour.\n\nLast 10 minutes\nThe result above is interesting because I usually have to be reminded by Fitbit to “move up to 250 steps in the hour”. I receive this notification during the last 10 minutes of the hour and I would think that during those 10 minutes I put more steps than during the first 50. The data show I’m wrong:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, I want to keep my reminder on. I feel like having it turned on definitely adds ~ 1000-2000 steps per day.\n\n\nDaily average\nLet’s get one level above and aggregate each day as a unit. This plot shows a nice trend, with months from May to August showing an increase on the number of steps. Keep in mind that November will show little average steps because for that month we have incomplete data (last day in database is 2019-11-13),\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this part of the analysis, I should make clear that I took vacations from 2019-06-27 to 2019-07-11. We will use this information in the analysis to make some things clear."

I chose to plot this by day of the week, to get an insight about periodicity of events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause I walked a lot during the vacations, I highlighted the days on top of the previous boxplot. Most of the extreme events are definitely during the vacations. Moreover, none of the days I walked less than 10K steps, pretty amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some extreme low events, these are quite likely the days I just don’t wear the fitbit (or days I forget to wear it for most of the day). Just because I can order the data and make another plot, I went ahead and did it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe usually go for walks on Saturdays and/or Sundays. Knowing this little piece of data, it’s quite expected to see Saturdays being the days with higher number of steps (and hence higher success rate on the 10K target)."

I actually changed a few things, I decided to keep the native sampling rate and use geom_line() instead of down-sampling and using geom_tile(). The overall trend is clear, movements during the morning and the afternoon that correlate well with going and coming back from work. Somewhere around July 2019 you can see the change in timezone when I took vacations. There are a couple of days in late May with continuously high or lacking values, I take this as one of the days I forgot the fitbit at home, likely spurious measures."
