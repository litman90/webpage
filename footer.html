<h3> Enjoy my creations? </h3>

<p> I'm so glad you're here. As you know, I create a blend of fiction, non-fiction, open-source software, and generative art - all of which I provide for free. </p>
<p> Creating quality content takes a lot of time and effort, and your support would mean the world to me. It would empower me to continue sharing my work and keep everything accessible for everyone. </p>

<h3> How can you support my work? </h3>

<p> There are two easy ways to contribute. You can become a patron on Patreon or make a donation via PayPal. Every bit helps to keep the creative juices flowing. </p>
