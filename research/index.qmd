I have been lucky to be involved in different research projects. 
For a brief description, check the sections below. You can also find my publications in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PnTVdPAAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Hunger & sleep Interactions

My current research involves understanding the interactions between hunger and sleep circuits.

## Social Deficits

A subset of children with autism spectrum disorder appear to show an improvement in their behavioural symptoms during the course of a fever. I have been fortunate to integrate a team studying the effects of the inflammatory response (mainly the role of Interleukin 17a) in mouse models of social deficits. 

Our work was published as [**IL-17a promotes sociability in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders**](https://rdcu.be/bZlsm)

## Maternal Behavior

During my time in the University of Massachusetts Amherst I studied maternal behavior in rats. I learned several new techniques and had my first experience working with rodents (actually switched from invertebrates to vertebrates!). 

This work materialized in my MSc. thesis: [**Mapping a pup-resposive pathway from medial preoptic area to ventral tegmental area.**](https://www.scholarworks.umass.edu/masters_theses_2/701/)

## Learning and Memory

### Learning in Crabs

In Argentina, my research was focused in Contextual Pavlovian Conditioning of the crab *Neohelice granulata*. The original paradigm was thoroughly described by [*Fusti√±ana et al., 2013*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23114692). We were able to expand this paradigm and unveil new unexpected long-term memories. Working in the Neurobiology of the Memory Lab has been a fulfilling experience. My research was materialized in my graduation thesis and a [subsecuent publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016643282100019X).
