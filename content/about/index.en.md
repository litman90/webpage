# About me

{{< image src="/img/m-grey-circle.png" alt="Matias Andina" position="center" style="height:250px;">}}

I continuously find myself mesmerized by the complexity of life. I finished my Biology Degree at University of Buenos Aires in 2015 and moved to the United States in order to continue my studies at University of Massachusetts Amherst. After obtaining my MSc, I continued doing neuroscience at MIT. You can find my CV [here](https://github.com/matiasandina/Webpage/blob/master/CV.pdf).


## My Questions

I believe that multicellular systems, and especially the nervous system, are best understood as a combination of heterogeneous single-cell behaviors. We animals face a permanent stream of information, must process it and behave accordingly to survive and thrive. How does the nervous system function based on its architecture? How does the brain encode stimuli and valence? What are the computations underlying a behavioral output? I dream of increasing our understanding about complex processes underlying behavioral responses involving stimuli encoding, motivation, and need.
