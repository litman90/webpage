During my time in the University of Massachusetts Amherst I studied maternal behavior in rats. I learned several new techniques and had my first experience working with rodents (actually switched from invertebrates to vertebrates!). 

This work materialized in my MSc. thesis: **Mapping a pup-resposive pathway from medial preoptic area to ventral tegmental area.**

Here's a nice picture of the mPOA with triple labelling: Fluorogold (yellow), Esr1 (red), c-Fos (white).
