<p>NATSCI191 - Final Project.</p>
<p>I designed different experiments (using Google Forms and Matlab Psychtoolbox). Students participated as subjects, later analyzed the data, and presented their findings in class. Information about this project is available on <a href="">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The learning objectives were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Familiarize students with graphical analysis of real data.</li>
<li>Create a presentation-like experience for students going into Life Sciences.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results were gratifying. Students were curious about the tasks and the results. I guess thereâ€™s a particular component given by the fact that all of them were subjects first. As a replication study, made during office hours and with a budged of 10 dollars for sodas and cups, I find it quite in line with previously reported findings (I felt so relieved). I will perform a more thorough analysis of the data, just for the fun.</p>
