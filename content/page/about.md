I continuously find myself mesmerized by the complexity of life. I finished my Biology Degree at University of Buenos Aires in 2015 and moved to the United States in order to continue my studies as a PhD student at University of Massachusetts Amherst. 


## My Questions

I believe that multicellular systems, and especially the nervous system, are best understood as a combination of heterogeneous single-cell behaviors. These are the result of stimuli integration via subcellular signalling and network level activity. How does the nervous system function based on its architecture? We animals face a permanent stream of information, must process it and behave accordingly to survive and thrive. what are the computations underlying a behavioral ouptut? I dream of increasing our understanding about complex processes underlying behavioral responses invloving motivation and need.
