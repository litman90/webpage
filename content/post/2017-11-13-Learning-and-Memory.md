In Argentina, my research was focused in Contextual Pavlovian Conditioning of the crab *Neohelice granulata*. The original paradigm was thoroughly described by [*Fustiñana et al., 2013*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23114692). We were able to expand this paradigm and unveil new unexpected long-term memories. Working in the Neurobiology of the Memory Lab has been a fulfilling experience. My research was materialized in my graduation thesis: 

**“Study of different long-term memories and participation of synaptic ERK/MAPK in memory consolidation”**
