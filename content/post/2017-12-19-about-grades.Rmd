I'm writing this post to document my own learning on reading from [Teaching Tips](https://books.google.com/books/about/McKeachie_s_Teaching_Tips_Strategies_Res.html?id=v_0zqB13lW8C) and [Teaching at its Best](https://books.google.com/books/about/Teaching_at_Its_Best.html?id=NC5P8z-u-H0C). 

## Calibrated instruments

McKeachie's chapter on grades starts with a set of questions that attack the problem of grading from a philosophical angle.

> what are grades? 

First define the problem (What is the system? What are the governing rules?). Do we agree that grades are communication tools? That is an extremely challenging and insightful question. Grades are indeed a communication tool that conveys information at many levels. A single letter or number on an arbitrary scale will intend to define a person.  

That value will communicate different things to students, parents, teachers within the university, and future employers, whether we are talking of admissions committes or managers in industry. Miscommunication hurts everyone, that is what assigning grades that do not represent the student do.

I stand with students first. Students have the right to know how well their performed and what are the things that they need to improve. That is the purpose of learning and improvement, which is contingent on positive and negative feedback. If I had to choose, I would have no grades but feedback, I would teach for mastery. But that is a discussion for another article and, since we live in a world dominated by grades, we have to play that game for now. 

> How valid is the instrument on which grades are based?

Whatever we are trying to measure (and communicate), it has to be measured using a valid instrument. Indeed, selecting accurate indicators of student performance might be the hardest part of the job.  

My natural tendency is to measure performance on an absolute scale. However, I am not alien of solid argumentation against this practice. First, I am not owner of the one and only absolute scale, I am subjective and conditioned by my own background. Second, I also fail. Teacher failure comes in many shapes and flavors (from not engaging and creating the proper learning environment to testing with wrong questions). In those situations, it is common sense to look for relative measures, evaluate how students performed in general terms. The reasoning would be that if all students failed to understand concept A:

1. The teacher was ineffective during the learning and feedback phase or
1. The teacher was ineffective during the testing phase

It would be really difficult to argue in favor of students getting punished by a suboptimal teaching performance. On the brightside, it is unlikely that, over the long run, consistently low performing students faced such a consistent set of low performing teachers. 

Being the nth best of an extremely well performing group should not put you into an "under-achiever" box. Chance had you sharing space with a sample of highly capable, highly driven individuals. Furthermore, this group likely worked well because all students contributed extraordinarly into the production of the learning experience (i.e, assignments, projects, debates, discussions, role play).  

Being the best of a group that is homogeneously underperforming is not indicative of academic achievement or technical skill. Therefore, the individual should not be promoted by the label of "top of the class". Reality says he is ranked first but that label is devoid of descriptive sample information and, most importantly, **it fails to meet criteria**.  



> How reliable is it?

Here's where we have to start thinking about population.

## Grade curving

Assuming *a priori* distributions might work well in statistical mechanics but it is certainly not the way to grade students. 

### Inflating

Here is where the *extra credit* comes in. Pressure to increase grades comes from everywhere. Universities opperating on a client based model depend upon costumer satisfaction to keep functioning. Moreover, whenever students do not pay themselves for the education, costumer and user become separated. Thus, universities can work as an insurance policy and a 4-year party at the same time. How do they keep the costumer satisfaction up? They know what they are selling, they serve themselves of the average salary of college graduates to advertise themselves, just as an insurance policy for retirement. They enforce, overlook or seldom punish. They fail in favor of the user, just like when you bought clothes that you didn't actually like, used them and returned asking for money back.

They also invest in branding. It is easy to be critic of the if you feel represented by the brand. Brands use abstract symbols that are vague enough to be . I wonder what would happen if schools used the time course of their own grade inflation instead of their name initials or mascot on their hoodies, T-shirts and mugs.  

Grade inflation existed for a noble cause in the past. If my students were dependent on good grades to stay out of a war, I would certainly inflate. Notice grade escalation during the Vietnam war period in the U.S. This also serves as an example of how an unofficial rule can spread with no top down regulation. Teachers collectively did what they thought best and that resulted in a systemic change. Maybe this collective behavior was not unspoken, grades during the 1970 decade grades deflated. From 1980 on, grades have been increasing.

What happens when everyone gets an A? That is a question that has been seriously treated [here](http://www.gradeinflation.com/tcr2012grading.pdf). I will add some humor to an overly long and boring post.

### Deflating

Deflating grades on purpose is a practice that produces a fit to a normal distribution according to an arbitrary central tendency and spread. I find that practice completely against the goals of teaching, at any level.  

There is a lingering question about *curving*: Where does the normal distribution come from? In other words, could it be possible that, for a given set of standards, the long-term distribution of fairly graded individuals follow a normal distribution?


## A systemic problem

I understand concerns about individual cases. But most of the defenders of grade inflation are 
"A professor has the right to give the grades he wants, but that’s always been understood with a responsibility that’s attached to it, mainly to see to it that you don’t debase our common currency - Harvey Mansfield"


## General Improvement

It is probably true that teaching has improved. Productivity, access to information, and computer proficienty have certainly improved. Those are fantastic news, but they should not serve as supporting evidence for scale deformation. If indeed we are training the best generation of students ever every year, then shortening the dynamic range is not informative (remember grades are a communication tool). If anything, the rescaling should maintain an informative dynamic range and there is good reason to set higher competency standards.
