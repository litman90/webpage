<p>This post is inspired by my brief experience with the education system in the United States (US) and the way some students approach learning. I do not know what it is. Maybe it has to do with the tsunami of multiple-choice exams they have to go through, the endless preparation for another standardized test or the glorification of the <em>take-home message</em> culture.</p>
<div id="how-do-you-make-a-cake" class="section level2">
<h2>How do you make a cake?</h2>
<p>I wrote a question for an assignment that was pointing towards mechanisms at the level of the synapse that could result in drug tolerance. The question went something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what is the mechanism of XYZ at the synapse and how is it related to tolerance?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, guessing will not really help to answer the question between <em>wrong</em> and <em>less wrong</em> options; you have to know what XYZ does and some bits and pieces that make up synapses.</p>
<p>If I was given this question, my first impulse is to Google. So I did:</p>
