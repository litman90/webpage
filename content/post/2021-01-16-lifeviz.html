<p>I have not made new year resolutions, I made <a href="https://matiasandina.netlify.app/2021/01/art-in-a-new-year/">art</a>. I also finally got some time to explore one of the little Shiny projects that were dormant in my <code>/Project</code> folder during most of 2020: <strong>lifeviz</strong>.</p>
<p>The goal of <a href="https://matias-andina.shinyapps.io/lifeviz">lifeviz</a> is to visualize life events. This has been inspired by the post <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html">‚ÄòThe Tail End‚Äô by WaitButWhy</a>. I have taken the visualizations and added a few degrees of freedom, so that the users can visualize the past/present. On the activities tab, users can display the remaining activity counts for things they could represent using emojis.</p>
<p>This is an example of what it can do:</p>

<div id="why-i-made-this" class="section level3">
<h3>Why I made this</h3>
<p>The idea is to produce reflection and general introspection about our time on Earth. Actually visualizing the number of remaining days/burgers/hugs, can be a powerful tool to do so. Check <a href="https://matias-andina.shinyapps.io/lifeviz">lifeviz here</a>.</p>
<p>As I briefly mentioned, this app has been created using Shiny and R. I have left all the details out of this post, but you might be interested.</p>

<h3>My life</h3>
<p>I have used the app to scratch my own itch, so this is my current status. If I live 90 years, these are the years past (gray), present (red) and left (unfilled).</p>
<p><img src="/img/lifeviz/years.png" /></p>
<p>I think this one is more actionable, gotta make those weeks count!</p>

<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>I try to meditate once a day<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. If I do so for the rest of my life, that‚Äôs a hell lot of meditation.</p>
<p><img src="/img/lifeviz/meditation.png" /></p>
<p>On the weekends, I am almost certain to get something tasty, probably with a capuccino ‚òï and a book üìñ. Let‚Äôs say I do this only once per weekend, let‚Äôs call it ‚ÄúSaturday Bakery Breakfast‚Äù</p>

<div id="the-goal" class="section level3">
<h3>The goal</h3>
<p>I hope using this app may help you appreciate the uniqueness of each of the moments we take for granted. I hope it makes you present, wherever, whenever you are. Enjoy.</p>
