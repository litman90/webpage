This post is to make a quick description/recipe for making. This post is as much for communication as for personal records.  

## Step 1 - The atlas itself

Starting material should be as good quality as possible. I used `.eps` files from Paxinos Rat Brain Atlas for doing this. On the cheap side of life, a *very* nice online resource can be found [here](http://labs.gaidi.ca/rat-brain-atlas/). Images could be imported to most image processing freeware and processed in a very similar way. 

## Step 2 - Load images into Inkscape

The process looks like this. Import files into Inkscape using the import dialog box.

## Step 3 - Convert to Grayscale

The blue borders are not really my thing. I would rather have them in grayscale (or white, to overlay ). We'll do grayscale for now. In Inkscape, do:

`Extensions > Color > Grayscale`  

## Step 4 - Get rid of the junk

Probably, all the letters are . We can do `Ctr+F` and find an `a` (or other letters). That helps us to get rid of the text fast and with little clicking. 

## Final Thoughts

From here on, just fixing it the way you want it. Here's the final result, after cleaning all the stuff I didn't like.
