<p>We have all been there, classic math riddle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many people need to be in one room so that the probability of two of them having the same birthday is more than 0.5?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a recent bootcamp exercise we tackled this in python and I wanted to share, just because it’s fun. I did it for a range of probabilities. My solution is probably not the fastest/shortest/most pythonic, but it’s a little thing I put out there so, if you want to use/improve it, please do!</p>
<pre class="python3"><code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


def prob(n):
    numerator = np.math.factorial(365) / np.math.factorial(365-n)
    denominator = 365 ** n
    return(1 - numerator/denominator)

probs = list(map(prob, range(100)))

plt.plot(range(len(probs)), probs)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<p>A bad translation into R, it would be something like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>prob &lt;- function(n){
  numerator = exp(lfactorial(365) - lfactorial(365-n))
    denominator = 365 ** n
    return(1 - numerator/denominator)
}

probs = sapply(0:99, function(n) prob(n))

plot(0:99, probs, type=&quot;l&quot;,
     main=&quot;Probability of 2 people having same birthday&quot;,
     xlab = &quot;People in a room&quot;, ylab=&quot;probability&quot;)</code></pre>
