<p>I have been struggling a lot with pain in my fingers and wrists.
I have tried setting up timers for using the keyboard.
But the only thing that seems to work is reducing the typing (aka get away from the computer and stop using the keyboard!).</p>
<p>Tracking hours didn‚Äôt work well, so I guess a last resort to force me is counting the actual number of keys per day and trying to keep that to a minimum.</p>
<p>After a little google searching, I found inspiration on this post: <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design-a-keylogger-in-python">Design a Keylogger in Python</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted something <strong>simple</strong>. Just count and save to file, in case future me wants to do some sort of analysis. Nothing fancy, no optimization. Most importantly something I can trust is not sending every keystroke I write over the internets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will be using pynput library</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html">pynput docs here</a>.</p>
<p>Of note, <code>pip3 install pynput</code> failed. If only python made it possible for people to install things ‚Ä¶ ü§∑</p>
<p>Anyway, mystery aside, <code>python -m pip install pynput</code> worked. I kind of trust (read blind faith) this library is safe enough. And my passwords are kinda there scrambled somewhere in the text file but I don‚Äôt plan to host the file anywhere so it‚Äôs reasonably safe (please don‚Äôt get remote access to my computer üôè).</p>
<p>The output to console (again, keep it simple) looks like this</p>
<pre><code>Today is 2020-06-11 and the key count is: 0
...
Today is 2020-06-11 and the key count is: 12000
Today is a brand new day :)
Today is 2020-06-12 and the key count is: 0
Today is 2020-06-12 and the key count is: 1000
Today is 2020-06-12 and the key count is: 2000
...
Today is 2020-06-12 and the key count is: 13000
Today is a brand new day :)
Today is 2020-06-13 and the key count is: 0
Today is 2020-06-13 and the key count is: 1000
