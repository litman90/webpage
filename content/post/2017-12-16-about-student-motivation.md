I'm writing this post to document my own learning on reading from [Teaching Tips](https://books.google.com/books/about/McKeachie_s_Teaching_Tips_Strategies_Res.html?id=v_0zqB13lW8C) and [Teaching at its Best](https://books.google.com/books/about/Teaching_at_Its_Best.html?id=NC5P8z-u-H0C). This particular post has to do with engaging students to contribute with questions to class. 

I have found chapter 11 of McKeachie's to be of great value, it contains lots of starting points for discussion and further analysis.

## Choice

Humans are into the *free will thing*. Access to choosing their own topic, exam questions and due dates might facilitate the learning experience and boost motivation through a feeling of agency. However, too much choice is normally a bad thing. Assignments like "write about anything" are not a good idea. 

### I plead guilty

I have incurred in the "write about anything" practice for some of my assignments. The way I try to convince myself that the strategy works, is by saying that "I keep the range of acceptable answers broad and do not constrain individual variability". I would sometimes say that to my students, which is received with mixed feelings. There is a sweet spot of "individual variability" within a constrained playground that I should look for. Leting them on the loose ends up hindering their production and diminishing motivation.

## Value

I have previously written about value and purpose [here](/2017/11/about-teaching-nonsense/). I am really glad that many concerns I had before reading McKeachie's have also apeared as concerns for the author. It is explicitely advised to teachers: **Teach with a sense of purpose**. Moreover, one should: 

> Make the value of the course explicit and take time to help students understand why what they are learning matters.
