Here's to the list things you are doing instead of research. I wasted some time by organizing the categories into logical clusters of endless misery. I wasted some more time finding people who agree with my complains.

* Back up.
* Hard drive space is not enough.
* Free space in local or personal network is not enough.
* University sponsored sync program does not sync.
* New computer, sync between your own files.
* Re-install life, yes you are going to use custom preferences.

* Deciding whether OS `A` or OS `B` is better.

* Being delusional and wishing to have just one copy per file between multiple OS.
* Compatibility between different OS running on different people's devices.
* Compatibility between people.

* working directories, paths and beyond.
* Packages, libraries, modules, snippets of codes that updated and are thus incompatible.

* University mail is not compatible with gmail.
