Here's to the list things you are doing instead of research. I wasted some time by organizing the categories into logical clusters of endless misery. I wasted some more time finding people who agree with my complains.

* Back up.
* Hard drive space is not enough.
* Free space in local or personal network is not enough.
* University sponsored sync program does not sync.
* New computer, sync between your own files.
* Re-install life, yes you are going to use custom preferences.

* Deciding whether OS `A` or OS `B` is better.

* Deciding you should use a double boot.
* Being delusional and wishing to have just one copy per file between multiple OS.
* Compatibility between different OS running on different people's devices.
* Compatibility between people.

* Proprietary software.
* Excel.
* Track changes didn't work.
* Likely that co-worker didn't track changes.
* Filenames are not useful. 
* `n` copies of the same file. Everywhere.
* `MYfile_Version_3.044_final_seriously_I_promise_OKFINE.something`

* Reference managers
* WYSIWYG vs LATEX
* LATEX fonts and templates.
* Special characters (as in anything outside the English Language).
* PDF does not compile for `X reason`.


* University mail is not compatible with gmail.  

* R working directory.
* MATLAB PATH.
* Working directories, paths and beyond.
* Packages, libraries, modules, snippets of codes that updated and are thus incompatible.

* Making meaningless lists like this one.
* Making meaningful lists of things you will never do.

* People writing dates in notoriously diverging formats.
