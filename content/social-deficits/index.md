A subset of children with autism spectrum disorder appear to show an improvement in their behavioural symptoms during the course of a fever. I have been fortunate to integrate a team studying the effects of the inflammatory response (mainly the role of Interleukin 17a) in mouse models of social deficits. 

Our work was published as [**IL-17a promotes sociability in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders**](https://rdcu.be/bZlsm)
