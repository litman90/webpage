Computational Material Scientist - Theoretical Chemist 


About Yair

Yair Litman is a dedicated theoretical chemist working at the Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry (University of Cambridge) with a passion for solving complex problems at the interface of chemistry, physics, and materials science.
 
Yair's research aims to accelerate the development of current and future energy-related technologies by providing atomistic-level understanding of key processes ocurring at liquid-solid interfaces. His primary foucus includes organic/inorganic, aqueous, and electrified interfaces. To tackle these challenges, Yair utilizes advanced first principles methods and employs machine learning techniques to achieve the accuracy and model complexity required by scientific question. He has developed theoretical methods to calculate (quantum) reaction rates and various types of spectroscopies, such as IR, Raman, tip-enhanced Raman, sum-frequency generation, among others. He enjoys collaborating with experimentalists and theoreticians alike.
