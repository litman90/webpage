I talk with my brain quite often, theoretical experiment ahead (pun intended): \n\n> **Brain**: How much would you need to be paid to do XYZ?  \n> **Me**: XYZ? Pff.....a lot, I cannot even tell you how much...  \n> **Brain**: I can tell you how much, your stipend it's coming from teaching XYZ class next semester.  \n> **Me**: What!?  \n> **Brain**: Yes, you've guessed...welcome to grad school.  \n\nWhen I have to teach these classes, I cannot help but wonder: why are we doing this? what is the purpose?\n\n## What is the purpose of higher education?\n\nI believe this question has no general answer. I find myself unsatisfied by the attempts to encapsulate higher education, particularly facing the fact that somewhere during this century human performance will be out-passed by computer's performance in the vast majority of tasks. I host a mix of hope and fear about that, but I am somewhat confident in the fact that it will happen. \n\nWhatever answer we go for, it is going to be highly dependent on the field. It will not be the same if you are doing Physics or Business. The lens through which you see the world, your daily mental framework, is going to be different. Yet, it appears to me that, from Public Policy perspective, we should find overlapping opinions. To a certain extent, this is such a fundamental issue that we cannot afford to have it diverge in the way it is diverging now. It not only affects the training students receive from an academic perspective, it **devaluates the degree** on the job market. Could we find a set of experiences and abilities (professional or personal) that we agree upon? \n\n## Mix and Match\n\nArguments towards diversification of higher education are everywhere, should we aim towards teaching the so called *well-rounded* individuals [^GRE]? I believe the borders dividing areas are blurry but they do exist. In that blurry interface, I believe there's a huge potential to win from interdisciplinary work. Moreover, I would venture to say that many of the groundbreaking work will only be possible due to interdisciplinary team efforts.
