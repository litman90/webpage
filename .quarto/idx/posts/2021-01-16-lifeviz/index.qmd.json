I also finally got some time to explore one of the little Shiny projects that were dormant in my `/Project` folder during most of 2020: **lifeviz**.\n\nThe goal of [lifeviz](https://matias-andina.shinyapps.io/lifeviz) is to visualize life events. This has been inspired by the post [â€˜The Tail Endâ€™ by WaitButWhy](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html). I have taken the visualizations and added a few degrees of freedom, so that the users can visualize the past/present. On the activities tab, users can display the remaining activity counts for things they could represent using emojis.\n\nThis is an example of what it can do:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matiasandina/lifeviz/main/example.gif)\n\n\nYou can find [lifeviz here](https://matias-andina.shinyapps.io/lifeviz).\n\n\n\nThe idea is to produce reflection and general introspection about our time on Earth. Actually visualizing the number of remaining days/burgers/hugs, can be a powerful tool to do so. Check [lifeviz here](https://matias-andina.shinyapps.io/lifeviz).\n\nAs I briefly mentioned, this app has been created using Shiny and R. I have left all the details out of this post, but you might be interested.   \n\n<details>\n  <summary>Show me the code</summary>\n  <p>You can check the code at https://github.com/matiasandina/lifeviz/</p>\n</details>\n\n\n### My life\n\nI have used the app to scratch my own itch, so this is my current status. If I live 90 years, these are the years past (gray), present (red) and left (unfilled).\n\n![](img/years.png)\n\nI think this one is more actionable, gotta make those weeks count!\n\n![](img/weeks.png)\n\n### Activities\n\nI try to meditate once a day[^maybe]. If I do so for the rest of my life, that's a hell lot of meditation.\n\n![](img/meditation.png)\n\nOn the weekends, I am almost certain to get something tasty, probably with a cappuccino â˜• and a book ðŸ“–. Let's say I do this only once per weekend, let's call it \"Saturday Bakery Breakfast\" \n\n![](img/bakery.png)\n\n### The goal\n\nI hope using this app may help you appreciate the uniqueness of each of the moments we take for granted. I hope it makes you present, wherever, whenever you are. Enjoy.\n\n\n[^maybe]: It's an aspirational goal, maybe someday I will get there.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI have not made new year resolutions, I made [art](https://matiasandina.netlify.app/2021/01/art-in-a-new-year/).
