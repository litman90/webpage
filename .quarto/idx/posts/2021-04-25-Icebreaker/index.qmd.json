At the same time, I wrote this post to provide new people in our team with basic knowledge about me, the new person they are working with.\n\nHere are the questions and my answers[^change].\n\n[^change]: My own answers might change overtime, I will try my best to keep a note of that change in this log.\n\n* **Would you say you are a morning person?**\n\nAverage. As of 2021, I am transitioning from night owl to early bird. Ask me again in a couple years.\n\n- **Do you like to be praised? Is it better to receive praise in public or in private?**\n\nI generally dislike to be praised. If anything must be said, I prefer that private and informal.\n\n- **What is your preferred method of communication for feedback?**\n\nUnless it's concrete feedback about a piece of work, something that is better written onto the work itself (e.g., code comments), I prefer conversation during a meeting. Written communication must be super accurate to avoid misunderstandings.\n\n- **When do you prefer to receive feedback—routinely in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?**\n\nBoth.\n\n- **What’s your favorite way to treat yourself?**\n\nFood.\n\n- **What makes you grumpy or turns you off?**\n\nIn general, having to do too many thing at the same time makes me grumpy and turns me off. Scheduling conflicts turn me off.\n\n- **How will I know you are not in good mood?**\n\nMy face will be good evidence.\n\n- **Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?**\n\nI believe I need more time to reflect and brainstorm. I have a thing for going after that new shiny challenge and investing more time on that than something that has known problems that must be solved.\n\n- **What type of people do you normally work best with?**\n\nI work best with people who communicate often and honor commitments. I work best with people who communicate with candor and create an atmosphere of trust where we can say things to each other because everyone wants the best for their teammate.\n\n- **What do you need from your teammates?**\n\nAdvice. Guidance. Intellectual stimulation.\n\n- **What do you need from your manager?**\n\nAdvice. Guidance. Intellectual stimulation. Space to think, support to do, pressure to maintain my work level and keep improving.\n\n- **How do I know when not to interrupt you?**\n\nIn general you can interrupt me. When I'm coding or reading are two of the worst moments though.\n\n- **What are the manager behaviors that you know you hate?**\n\nDisplays of preference towards a member of the team. Being extremely hands-off, especially as a result of not liking the member's work or the outcomes the work is generating.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThere are many managers I admire, some of whom I was lucky personally meet, others I \"know\" through reading their books/blogs.\n\nI have have borrowed different questions and suggestions I liked from these managers to create an *Icebreaker*, a set of questions that can quickly provide me information about a new person I'm working with.
