I worked for several years at **<a href=https://bacon.com.ar/en/home/> Laborations Bacon </a>** under the supervision of Lic. Guillermo Casale, producing
and developing different radiopharmaceuticals.

As a part of the R&D team, I developed the synthesis of two important drugs, namely:

-  **<a href=https://bacon.com.ar/en/producto/colina-2/> 18F-Choline </a>**: used for the diagnosis of the initial stages of prostate cancer.
-  **<a href=https://bacon.com.ar/en/producto/dopa/> 18F-l-Dopa </a>**: used for detecting activity loss of functional dopaminergic nerve endings.


Example of brain PET-scans of healthy and sick patients using 18F-DOPA:

Early mornings (~4 am), I used to have fun carrying out nuclear reactions, more precisely 18O(p,n)18F,
to synthesize **<a href=https://bacon.com.ar/en/producto/fdg/> 18F-FDG </a>**.

Would like to know more? Check out this **<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxyqFK2KRI&t=4s> video </a>**  on how the 18F nucleus  is created inside the IBA cyclotrons.
