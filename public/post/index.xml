      <description>This post is to make a quick description/recipe for making. This post is as much for communication as for personal records.
Step 1 - The atlas itself Starting material should be as good quality as possible. I used .eps files from Paxinos Rat Brain Atlas for doing this. On the cheap side of life, a very nice online resource can be found here. Images could be imported to most image processing freeware and processed in a very similar way.</description>

      <description>For many purposes, I find myself in need of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Thus, I experienced a forceful transition to Matlab. Let’s be honest, Matlab can do powerful things, it’s a great language to attempt to dominate (note to self: learn python!). However, I find myself over and over thinking in R mode. Something along the lines of:
Gimme all the files in…
Will be easily accomplished in R</description>

      <description>I have been having a recurrent nightmare in the Statistics class I’m teaching. The nightmare goes like:
We used an independent sample t-test and found a significant correlations (t(df)=…).
It also comes in the shape of non-significant data, maybe even more haunting than the first version.
We found a non-significant difference between Factor level A (M= …, SD= … ) and Factor level B (M= …, SD= …), meaning there is a negative correlation between Factor and response variable.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s to the list things you are doing instead of research. I wasted some time by organizing the categories into logical clusters of endless misery. I wasted some more time finding people who agree with my complains.
 Back up. Hard drive space is not enough. Free space in local or personal network is not enough. University sponsored sync program does not sync. New computer, sync between your own files. Re-install life, yes you are going to use custom preferences.</description>

      <description>Grading on ProgressGrading on progress makes sense, equal effort equal remuneration. But the question we are trying to quantify with a grade is another one. We are trying to get a quantity in any scale that represents achievement. Particularly, we are interested in degree of achievement of the goals set at the beginning of the course by the professor.
Great, so…How much do students learn? That is a difficult question, let’s simplify by assuming some conditions:</description>

      <description>I came accross a book on the &amp;ldquo;Free Books&amp;rdquo; table a while ago. I found The Writing Teacher&amp;rsquo;s Sourcebook edited by Gary Tate and Edward P.J. Corbett. I glanced over it today and found these fantastic rules. They are called rules of composition, but I believe they are vastly generalizable. Any composition would benefit. I thought I should share. List has no numeric order, author&amp;rsquo;s touch there1.
Eleventh law of composition: Some things precede other things.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post to document my own learning on reading from Teaching Tips and Teaching at its Best.
I have found chapter 11 of McKeachie&amp;rsquo;s to be of great value, it contains lots of starting points for discussion and further analysis.
Choice Humans are into the free will thing. Access to choosing their own topic, exam questions and due dates might facilitate the learning experience and boost motivation through a feeling of agency.</description>

Calibrated instrumentsMcKeachie’s chapter 10 starts with a set of questions that attack the problem of grading from a philosophical angle.
what are grades?
First define the problem (What is the system? What are the governing rules?). Do we agree that grades are communication tools? That is an extremely challenging and insightful question.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post to document my own learning on reading from Teaching Tips and Teaching at its Best.
Assignments and Feedback Chapters 7 and 8 on McKeachie&amp;rsquo;s Teaching tips are quite interesting and develop different lines of thought about assignments. One thing I can relate to is the idea of providing general examples of errors students normally do. This procedure comes handy when dealing with essay questions (the ones I like far more than any other).</description>

      <description>I’m writing this post to document my own learning on reading from Teaching Tips and Teaching at its Best. This particular post has to do with engaging students to contribute with questions to class.
Checking student understandingDuring class, there is a moment in which you feel that you’ve covered a couple of ideas in the way you wanted to and you decide to check if everything is alright. Other times, you feel as if you weren’t able to convey the points in the way you wanted to.</description>

      <description>Start with WhyI am writing because I believe there is a powerful message in the ideas of Simon Sinek. I am also writing because I realized that we have already experienced mild and terrible consequences when certain people get this wrong. Simon Sinek is the author of interesting material such as Start with why and Leaders eat Last. I have had a great time reading his books and watching him talk.</description>

      <description>Life without purposeLiving without a purpose is something I am unable to do. I am into the rules of the game, the idea that there’s a goal, and we are trying to achieve something, do something, create an object or service that was not there before and now fulfills a function. There are few games that I play for the sake of keep playing like the learning game. But, more often than not, I stand on the side of finite games.</description>

      <description>This post is inspired by my brief experience with the education system in the United States (US) and the way some students approach learning. I do not know what it is. Maybe it has to do with the tsunami of multiple-choice exams they have to go through, or the endless preparation for another standardized test on the horizon, or the glorification of the take-home message culture.
I wrote a question for an assignment that was pointing towards mechanisms at the level of the synapse that could result in drug tolerance.</description>

      <description>In Argentina, my research was focused in Contextual Pavlovian Conditioning of the crab Neohelice granulata. The original paradigm was thoroughly described by Fustiñana et al., 2013. We were able to expand this paradigm and unveil new unexpected long-term memories. Working in the Neurobiology of the Memory Lab has been a fulfilling experience. My research was materialized in my graduation thesis:
“Study of different long-term memories and participation of synaptic ERK/MAPK in memory consolidation”</description>
