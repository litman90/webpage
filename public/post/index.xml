      <description>Paying attention to the small details sounds trivial. Talking about a 1% increase in performance sounds trivial. Unexciting. A rounding error.
Setting systems up sounds boring. You have to troubleshoot them, you have to stress test them. After all the effort required for their creation, the systems you&amp;rsquo;ve created usually still haven&amp;rsquo;t solved the problem that first got you to think about setting the system up in the first place.</description>

      <description>It’s been a bit more than a year since I got a fitbit and I have been pretty excited about tracking my activity and heart rate. I should say I’m quite surprised about the sleep data. Tracking sleep has been, in fact, the most exciting feature, and I now strive to get at least 7 hours of sleep per night.

      <description>I have been thinking about different problems I have when writing code and the things that I normally try to do to keep my projects clean and functional. I wrote this post to put this thoughts out there, hopefully I will receive input from the great software engineers out there.

      <title>Skype a Scientist part 2</title>

      <description>I have been lucky to participate in the project lead by Sarah McAnulty called Skype a scientist. I recently did two more calls with 11th grade students who attend Dowal school in Honduras. This was the first time I did Skype a Scientist in Spanish!
As usual, I should say it was great to be able to talk with students, tell them about science in general and my research. It was really fun to answer their questions.</description>

      <description>Hace rato que vengo viendo ciertas tendencias de gente que hace algo de análisis de datos con la actualidad Argentina. Por ejemplo, Daniel Schteingart comúnmente publica este tipo de análisis en diversos medios. Esto me llevó a buscar datos abiertos disponibles para jugar un rato.
En general, a mí me interesa más debatir sobre la implementación de políticas y pienso que el Poder Legislativo merece mayor atención. Siento que sobrestimamos (para bien y para mal) el poder de un Ejecutivo que es, al final del día, mucho menos determinante que aquellos que escriben las leyes según las cuales se rige el Estado.</description>

      <title>Birthday Meritocracy</title>

      <description>We believe in meritocracy as one of the cornerstones of Western civilization. This idea is so embedded in our culture that we seldom question it. We praise those driven individuals who combine effort and talent to make it to the top. They smile in the cover of the magazines, the dreams of children and the nightmares of adults. Sports might be the activity where the blood, sweat and tears feel most real (maybe I should say relatable) and therefore are most notoriously broadcasted to the world.</description>

      <description>This post is made as a backup for the data visualization challenge number 2. Data comes from the daily posts of the members of the Data Visualization Society (DVS) on the DVS Slack channels. You can see everybody’s submissions for the challenge here.
I am also very motivated to explore the dark versions of the ggplot themes. The package I’m going to be using is called ggdark.

      <description>I am keen on tracking things. Some people call this personal analytics, I call it fun. In this post, I will explore how to extract your email information using python and R. My goal is to do some analysis on the data and, hopefully, explore different visualizations that can inform future behavior.

      <description>Here’s how the story usually goes. It starts with you, sitting in front of the computer screen, thinking: What a lovely day for some data analysis!. This day is great because you have collected some data or maybe because you happened to find some data somewhere, begging to be part of a smoking good plot.

      <title>Query Pubmed in R</title>

      <description>I have seen a couple of presentations that use plots of PubMed query results. I have even seen some of them in papers. I just think it’s really cool, so I wanted to play with something that could provide the data.
A couple of google searches lead me into two nice options to do this in R.
RISmed package, see CRAN or Dave Tang’s Blog A custom approach from Kristoffer Magnusson  I went with the custom approach, decided to borrow heavily from Kristoffer’s repo, and did a few modifications here and there.</description>
