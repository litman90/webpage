      <description>I continuously find myself mesmerized by the complexity of life. I finished my Biology Degree at University of Buenos Aires in 2015 and moved to the United States in order to continue my studies as a PhD student at University of Massachusetts Amherst.

      <description>I will add here ideas and projects from my teaching experiences.
ProjectsNATSCI191 - Final Project.
I designed different experiments (using Google Forms and Matlab Psychtoolbox). Students participated as subjects, later analyzed the data, and presented their findings in class. Information about this project is available on GitHub.
The learning objectives were:
Familiarize students with graphical analysis of real data.Create a presentation-like experience for students going into Life Sciences.</description>
