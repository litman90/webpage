      <description>I love games. I enjoy the fun in many formats: cards, boards, consoles. Yet, over the years, chess has consolidated as the game I play most often, and it is likely the only game I both really like and can limit the amount I play1.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of months since I noticed something weird going on in my games, a sort of disturbance in the force. I felt I was playing a type of position called Queen&amp;rsquo;s Gambit way more often than normal.</description>
