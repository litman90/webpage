      <description>I have not made resolutions for this year1. I have instead spent that time playing with patterns on a canvas. It’s been a while since I wanted to have some time to do generative art using geometric figures and I finally got down to it on the very first day of this year. I found a fountain of joy after just a few hours of tinkering, something inside tells me this could be a new New Year’s tradition for me.</description>
