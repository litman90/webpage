      <description>I have been asked to unveil a bit of what&amp;rsquo;s under the hood on this post. I decided to make a new post to share how my creative process took place and maybe inspire others to play along.
Something interesting about all of this is how well it plays into common sense. Looking at things from a different perspective, in this case adding just a rotation, can yield outstanding results.</description>

      <description>I have not made resolutions for this year1. I have instead spent that time playing with patterns on a canvas. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wanted to have some time to do generative art using geometric figures and I finally got down to it on the very first day of this year. I found a fountain of joy after just a few hours of tinkering, something inside tells me this could be a new New Year&amp;rsquo;s tradition for me.</description>
