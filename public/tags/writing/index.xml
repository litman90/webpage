      <description>This month has been fast. The writing has been really interesting, I was able to get some old stories written and had a lot of fun doing it. I would like to continue with the habit, it is already making it easier for me to put words into text. I’m not sure about the quality, but I experience the writing ease for both Spanish and English.
The data I had some pretty long bouts on Saturday and Sunday, writing close to 3000 words in aggregate.</description>

      <description>Third week has had ups and downs. I finished another short story. But I keep losing the word count battle. Yes, again, work.
The data The word count data is somewhat similar to what I’ve seen for last week. Definitely writing bouts are going down, just being able to write a few words before bedtime knocks me over.
Looking at the aggregate, the downward slope of the third week is a little bit disappointing.</description>

      <description>During the second week of the challenge I had a lot of late working days. It has been certainly tiresome. As a consequence, I was less able to write, got home really tired.
I still have that voice powering my desire to write. Actually, over the weekend I finished a short story that I had in my list for at least a year. That achievement feels really good and pumps the desire to keep writing and, most importantly, finishing more projects than those I start.</description>

      <description>This week I did a couple of new things.
 I moved to Boston. I started a new job. I started writing almost everyday.  Out of these three things, writing has proven to be the most challenging.
However, it’s increasingly building into a good habit. I can feel somewhere in my brain a voice that tells me “we have to write today”. Even though I was not planning to write the article today, I ended up going for it anyways.</description>

      <description>It’s been a while since I have several things to write in the back of my mind. I finally got the will to commit myself to one of those goal oriented challenges: Writing 2000 words a day.
It might sound like a bit much, now that I think about it, but today is Day 1 so I might as well get to do it. I have not limited the type of content I will write, my aim is to get as fluent as possible and to have writing become habitual.</description>

      <title>Rules of Composition</title>

      <description>I came accross a book on the &amp;ldquo;Free Books&amp;rdquo; table a while ago. I found The Writing Teacher&amp;rsquo;s Sourcebook edited by Gary Tate and Edward P.J. Corbett. I glanced over it today and found these fantastic rules. They are called rules of composition, but I believe they are vastly generalizable. Any composition would benefit. I thought I should share. List has no numeric order, author&amp;rsquo;s touch there1.
Eleventh law of composition: Some things precede other things.</description>
