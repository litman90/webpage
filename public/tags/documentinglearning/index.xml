      <description>This month has been fast. The writing has been really interesting, I was able to get some old stories written and had a lot of fun doing it. I would like to continue with the habit, it is already making it easier for me to put words into text. I’m not sure about the quality, but I experience the writing ease for both Spanish and English.
The data I had some pretty long bouts on Saturday and Sunday, writing close to 3000 words in aggregate.</description>

      <description>Third week has had ups and downs. I finished another short story. But I keep losing the word count battle. Yes, again, work.
The data The word count data is somewhat similar to what I’ve seen for last week. Definitely writing bouts are going down, just being able to write a few words before bedtime knocks me over.
Looking at the aggregate, the downward slope of the third week is a little bit disappointing.</description>

      <description>During the second week of the challenge I had a lot of late working days. It has been certainly tiresome. As a consequence, I was less able to write, got home really tired.
I still have that voice powering my desire to write. Actually, over the weekend I finished a short story that I had in my list for at least a year. That achievement feels really good and pumps the desire to keep writing and, most importantly, finishing more projects than those I start.</description>

      <description>This week I did a couple of new things.
 I moved to Boston. I started a new job. I started writing almost everyday.  Out of these three things, writing has proven to be the most challenging.
However, it’s increasingly building into a good habit. I can feel somewhere in my brain a voice that tells me “we have to write today”. Even though I was not planning to write the article today, I ended up going for it anyways.</description>

      <description>It’s been a while since I have several things to write in the back of my mind. I finally got the will to commit myself to one of those goal oriented challenges: Writing 2000 words a day.
It might sound like a bit much, now that I think about it, but today is Day 1 so I might as well get to do it. I have not limited the type of content I will write, my aim is to get as fluent as possible and to have writing become habitual.</description>

      <title>Rules of Composition</title>

      <description>I came accross a book on the &amp;ldquo;Free Books&amp;rdquo; table a while ago. I found The Writing Teacher&amp;rsquo;s Sourcebook edited by Gary Tate and Edward P.J. Corbett. I glanced over it today and found these fantastic rules. They are called rules of composition, but I believe they are vastly generalizable. Any composition would benefit. I thought I should share. List has no numeric order, author&amp;rsquo;s touch there1.
Eleventh law of composition: Some things precede other things.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post to document my own learning on reading from Teaching Tips and Teaching at its Best.
I have found chapter 11 of McKeachie&amp;rsquo;s to be of great value, it contains lots of starting points for discussion and further analysis.
Choice Humans are into the free will thing. Access to choosing their own topic, exam questions and due dates might facilitate the learning experience and boost motivation through a feeling of agency.</description>

      <description>I’m writing this post to document my own learning on reading from Teaching Tips and Teaching at its Best.
Calibrated instruments McKeachie’s chapter 10 starts with a set of questions that attack the problem of grading from a philosophical angle.
 what are grades?
 First define the problem (What is the system? What are the governing rules?). Do we agree that grades are communication tools? That is an extremely challenging and insightful question.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post to document my own learning on reading from Teaching Tips and Teaching at its Best.
Assignments and Feedback Chapters 7 and 8 on McKeachie&amp;rsquo;s Teaching tips are quite interesting and develop different lines of thought about assignments. One thing I can relate to is the idea of providing general examples of errors students normally do. This procedure comes handy when dealing with essay questions (the ones I like far more than any other).</description>

      <description>I’m writing this post to document my own learning on reading from Teaching Tips and Teaching at its Best. This particular post has to do with engaging students to contribute with questions to class.
Checking student understanding During class, there is a moment in which you feel that you’ve covered a couple of ideas in the way you wanted to and you decide to check if everything is alright. Other times, you feel as if you weren’t able to convey the points in the way you wanted to.</description>
