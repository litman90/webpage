      <description>I have seen a couple of presentations that use plots of PubMed query results. I have even seen some of them in papers. I just think it&amp;rsquo;s really cool, so I wanted to play with something that could provide the data.
A couple of google searches lead me into two nice options to do this in R.
 RISmed package, see CRAN or Dave Tang&amp;rsquo;s Blog A custom approach from Kristoffer Magnusson  I went with the custom approach, decided to borrow heavily from Kristoffer&amp;rsquo;s repo, and did a few modifications here and there.</description>
