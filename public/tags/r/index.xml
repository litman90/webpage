      <description>I have not made new year resolutions, I made art. I also finally got some time to explore one of the little Shiny projects that were dormant in my /Project folder during most of 2020: lifeviz.
The goal of lifeviz is to visualize life events. This has been inspired by the post ‘The Tail End’ by WaitButWhy. I have taken the visualizations and added a few degrees of freedom, so that the users can visualize the past/present.</description>

      <title>Rotating perspectives</title>

      <description>I have been asked to unveil a bit of what’s under the hood on this post. I decided to make a new post to share how my creative process took place and maybe inspire others to play along.
Something interesting about all of this is how well it plays into common sense. Looking at things from a different perspective, in this case adding just a rotation, can yield outstanding results.</description>

      <title>Art in a New Year</title>

      <description>I have not made resolutions for this year1. I have instead spent that time playing with patterns on a canvas. It’s been a while since I wanted to have some time to do generative art using geometric figures and I finally got down to it on the very first day of this year. I found a fountain of joy after just a few hours of tinkering, something inside tells me this could be a new New Year’s tradition for me.</description>

      <description>I have experienced a few explosions here and there. Yes, it’s me not reading the docs. But it’s also me, assuming that verbs mean one thing and not another. Let’s do some unique operations in different languages.
The MATLAB way &amp;gt;&amp;gt; unique([3, 3, 3, 90, 10]) ans = 3 10 90  The Python way &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import numpy as np &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; np.unique([3, 3, 3, 90, 10]) array([ 3, 10, 90])  The R way unique(c(3,3,3, 90, 10)) ## [1] 3 90 10 This is what I would expect.</description>

      <title>Birthday Problem</title>

      <description>We have all been there, classic math riddle:
 How many people need to be in one room so that the probability of two of them having the same birthday is more than 0.5?
 In a recent bootcamp exercise we tackled this in python and I wanted to share, just because it’s fun. I did it for a range of probabilities. My solution is probably not the fastest/shortest/most pythonic, but it’s a little thing I put out there so, if you want to use/improve it, please do!</description>

      <description>It’s been a bit more than a year since I got a fitbit and I have been pretty excited about tracking my activity and heart rate. I should say I’m quite surprised about the sleep data. Tracking sleep has been, in fact, the most exciting feature, and I now strive to get at least 7 hours of sleep per night.

      <description>I have been thinking about different problems I have when writing code and the things that I normally try to do to keep my projects clean and functional. I wrote this post to put this thoughts out there, hopefully I will receive input from the great software engineers out there.

      <description>Hace rato que vengo viendo ciertas tendencias de gente que hace algo de análisis de datos con la actualidad Argentina. Por ejemplo, Daniel Schteingart comúnmente publica este tipo de análisis en diversos medios. Esto me llevó a buscar datos abiertos disponibles para jugar un rato.
En general, a mí me interesa más debatir sobre la implementación de políticas y pienso que el Poder Legislativo merece mayor atención. Siento que sobrestimamos (para bien y para mal) el poder de un Ejecutivo que es, al final del día, mucho menos determinante que aquellos que escriben las leyes según las cuales se rige el Estado.</description>

      <description>This post is made as a backup for the data visualization challenge number 2. Data comes from the daily posts of the members of the Data Visualization Society (DVS) on the DVS Slack channels. You can see everybody’s submissions for the challenge here.
I am also very motivated to explore the dark versions of the ggplot themes. The package I’m going to be using is called ggdark.

      <description>I am keen on tracking things. Some people call this personal analytics, I call it fun. In this post, I will explore how to extract your email information using python and R. My goal is to do some analysis on the data and, hopefully, explore different visualizations that can inform future behavior.
