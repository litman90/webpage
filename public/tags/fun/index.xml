      <description>I love games. I enjoy the fun in many formats: cards, boards, consoles. Yet, over the years, chess has consolidated as the game I play most often, and it is likely the only game I both really like and can limit the amount I play1.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of months since I noticed something weird going on, a sort of disturbance in the force. I felt I was playing a type of position called Queen&amp;rsquo;s Gambit way more often than normal.</description>

      <description>I have experienced a few explosions here and there. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s me not reading the docs. But it&amp;rsquo;s also me, assuming that verbs mean one thing and not another. Let&amp;rsquo;s do some unique operations in different languages.
The MATLAB way &amp;gt;&amp;gt; unique([3, 3, 3, 90, 10]) ans = 3 10 90  The Python way &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import numpy as np &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; np.unique([3, 3, 3, 90, 10]) array([ 3, 10, 90])  The R way unique(c(3,3,3, 90, 10))  ## [1] 3 90 10  This is what I would expect.</description>

      <title>Birthday Problem</title>

      <description>We have all been there, classic math riddle:
 How many people need to be in one room so that the probability of two of them having the same birthday is more than 0.5?
 In a recent bootcamp exercise we tackled this in python and I wanted to share, just because it&amp;rsquo;s fun. I did it for a range of probabilities. My solution is probably not the fastest/shortest/most pythonic, but it&amp;rsquo;s a little thing I put out there so, if you want to use/improve it, please do!</description>

      <title>Python Keylogger</title>

      <description>I have been struggling a lot with pain in my fingers and wrists. I have tried setting up timers for using the keyboard. But the only thing that seems to work is reducing the typing (aka get away from the computer and stop using the keyboard!).
Tracking hours didn&amp;rsquo;t work well, so I guess a last resort to force me is counting the actual number of keys per day and trying to keep that to a minimum.</description>

      <title>Complex Fun</title>

      <description>People say that if you have to explain a joke, it loses value. Probably true. I guess I just wanted to partially comment on how different disciplines analyze different levels of complexity.
As molecular biologist, I think we were trained to seldom think about the whole system, we were trained to just give up complexity and focus on a couple of fancy names (yes, YFG fits pretty well as the center of this Universe).</description>
