      <description>There are many traders and most of them blow up at some point in their careers1. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why we worship those who don&amp;rsquo;t. We find rational explanations for their success, which basically boil down to saying they are smarter/faster/bolder/better than everyone else. We may even go as far as justifying success at all costs.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of skill involved in playing dice with such great results over such a long period of time.</description>
