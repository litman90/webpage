      <description>I have not made new year resolutions, I made art. I also finally got some time to explore one of the little Shiny projects that were dormant in my /Project folder during most of 2020: lifeviz.
The goal of lifeviz is to visualize life events. This has been inspired by the post ‘The Tail End’ by WaitButWhy. I have taken the visualizations and added a few degrees of freedom, so that the users can visualize the past/present.</description>

      <description>People say that if you have to explain a joke, it loses value. Probably true. I guess I just wanted to partially comment on how different disciplines analyze different levels of complexity.
As molecular biologist, I think we were trained to seldom think about the whole system, we were trained to just give up complexity and focus on a couple of fancy names (yes, YFG fits pretty well as the center of this Universe).</description>
