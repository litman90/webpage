      <description>I have been lucky to participate in the project lead by Sarah McAnultycalled Skype a scientist. So far, I have done calls with two grades:
3rd Grade Johnston Elementary School, Irving, TX.7th Grade Isbell Middle School, Santa Paula, CA.I should say it was great to be able to talk with students, tell them about science in general and my research. It was really fun to answer their questions.</description>
