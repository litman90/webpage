      <description>I have been lucky to participate in the project lead by Sarah McAnulty called Skype a scientist. I recently did two more calls with 11th grade students who attend Dowal school in Honduras. This was the first time I did Skype a Scientist in Spanish!
As usual, I should say it was great to be able to talk with students, tell them about science in general and my research. It was really fun to answer their questions.</description>

      <description>I have been lucky to participate in the project lead by Sarah McAnulty called Skype a scientist. So far, I have done calls with two grades:
 3rd Grade Johnston Elementary School, Irving, TX. 7th Grade Isbell Middle School, Santa Paula, CA.  I should say it was great to be able to talk with students, tell them about science in general and my research. It was really fun to answer their questions.</description>
