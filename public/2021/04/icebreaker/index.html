                <p>There are many managers I admire, some of whom I was lucky personally meet, others I &ldquo;know&rdquo; through reading their books/blogs.</p>

<p>I have have borrowed different questions and suggestions I liked from these managers to create an <em>Icebreaker</em>, a set of questions that can quickly provide me information about a new person I&rsquo;m working with. At the same time, I wrote this post to provide new people in our team with basic knowledge about me, the new person they are working with.</p>

<p>Here are the questions and my answers<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:change"><a href="#fn:change">1</a></sup>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Would you say you are a morning person?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Average. As of 2021, I am transitioning from night owl to early bird. Ask me again in a couple years.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do you like to be praised? Is it better to receive praise in public or in private?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I generally dislike to be praised. If anything must be said, I prefer that private and informal.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What is your preferred method of communication for feedback?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Unless it&rsquo;s concrete feedback about a piece of work, something that is better written onto the work itself (e.g., code comments), I prefer conversation during a meeting. Written communication must be super accurate to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>When do you prefer to receive feedback—routinely in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Both.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What’s your favorite way to treat yourself?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Food.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What makes you grumpy or turns you off?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In general, having to do too many thing at the same time makes me grumpy and turns me off. Scheduling conflicts turn me off.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How will I know you are not in good mood?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>My face will be good evidence.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I believe I need more time to reflect and brainstorm. I have a thing for going after that new shiny challenge and investing more time on that than something that has known problems that must be solved.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What type of people do you normally work best with?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I work best with people who communicate often and honor commitments. I work best with people who communicate with candor and create an atmosphere of trust where we can say things to each other because everyone wants the best for their teammate.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What do you need from your teammates?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Advice. Guidance. Intellectual stimulation.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What do you need from your manager?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Advice. Guidance. Intellectual stimulation. Space to think, support to do, pressure to maintain my work level and keep improving.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How do I know when not to interrupt you?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In general you can interrupt me. When I&rsquo;m coding or reading are two of the worst moments though.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What are the manager behaviors that you know you hate?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Displays of preference towards a member of the team. Being extremely hands-off, especially as a result of not liking the member&rsquo;s work or the outcomes the work is generating.</p>
