<h2>Creating the checklist</h2>
<p>The main text comes from <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html">here</a>. For simplicity, I have only used the main paragraph (aka, copy and paste the second paragraph). I omitted it here because it would be long and you can read it in the native format from the source.</p>
<p>In the code chunk below I comment the steps I took.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># text is copy-paste of the second paragraph
# text &lt;- c(&quot;...&quot;) ... == copy-paste

# split using &quot;; &quot;
sp &lt;- stringr::str_split(text, &quot;; &quot;)

# To create a checklist
# DASH SPACE [ ] SPACE SPACE
sp &lt;- paste0(&quot;- [ ]  &quot;, unlist(sp))
# append markdown title
sp &lt;- c(&quot;# Paul Graham&#39;s Writing Checklist&quot;, sp)

# Capitalize first letter of every sentence
sp &lt;- stringr::str_to_sentence(sp)</code></pre>
<p>If you want to write it to file, you can use <code>writeLines()</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code># write
fileConn &lt;- file(&quot;paul_graham_writing_checklist.md&quot;)
writeLines(sp, fileConn)
close(fileConn)

# If you want to knit to html you can do this
# knitr::knit2html(&quot;paul_graham_writing_checklist.md&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s take a look at the product:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># printing for web post
cat(sp, sep = &quot;\n&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code># Paul graham&#39;s writing checklist
- [ ]  Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can
- [ ]  Rewrite it over and over
- [ ]  Cut out everything unnecessary
- [ ]  Write in a conversational tone
- [ ]  Develop a nose for bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours
- [ ]  Imitate writers you like
- [ ]  If you can&#39;t get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said
- [ ]  Expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong
- [ ]  Be confident enough to cut
- [ ]  Have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which bits are confusing or drag
- [ ]  Don&#39;t (always) make detailed outlines
- [ ]  Mull ideas over for a few days before writing
- [ ]  Carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you
- [ ]  Start writing when you think of the first sentence
- [ ]  If a deadline forces you to start before that, just say the most important sentence first
- [ ]  Write about stuff you like
- [ ]  Don&#39;t try to sound impressive
- [ ]  Don&#39;t hesitate to change the topic on the fly
- [ ]  Use footnotes to contain digressions
- [ ]  Use anaphora to knit sentences together
- [ ]  Read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the paragraphs you dread reading)
- [ ]  Try to tell the reader something new and useful
- [ ]  Work in fairly big quanta of time
- [ ]  When you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far
- [ ]  When you finish, leave yourself something easy to start with
- [ ]  Accumulate notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file
- [ ]  Don&#39;t feel obliged to cover any of them
- [ ]  Write for a reader who won&#39;t read the essay as carefully as you do, just as pop songs are designed to sound ok on crappy car radios
- [ ]  If you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately
- [ ]  Ask friends which sentence you&#39;ll regret most
- [ ]  Go back and tone down harsh remarks
- [ ]  Publish stuff online, because an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more ideas
- [ ]  Print out drafts instead of just looking at them on the screen
- [ ]  Use simple, germanic words
- [ ]  Learn to distinguish surprises from digressions
- [ ]  Learn to recognize the approach of an ending, and when one appears, grab it.</code></pre>
<p>The checklist is not in strict chronological order, so I might try to reshape it later into something that would make more sense as a timeline. It will render as a checklist in something that is GitHub flavored (e.g., on GitHub). However, I will probably just use it as text file or print it as is.</p>
<p>I also noticed that the link for the Spanish translation is broken/outdated, so I tried my best to translate it. <a href="/2020/01/escribiendo-en-pocas-palabras/">Here it is</a></p>

<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I think this checklist is an awesome learning opportunity and a clear path to improving one’s writing. Quite happy to have found it, looking forward to improving my skills.</p>
<p>I got to learn a few cool R things like, 1) I can use <code>writeLines()</code> to write a <code>.md</code> file and 2) <code>stringr::str_to_sentence()</code> is an <strong>awesome</strong> function.</p>
