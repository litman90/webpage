      <description>There are many traders and most of them blow up at some point in their careers1. Maybe that’s why we worship those who don’t. We find rational explanations for their success, which basically boil down to saying they are smarter/faster/bolder/better than everyone else. We may even go as far as justifying success at all costs.
I’m sure there’s a lot of skill involved in playing dice with such great results over such a long period of time.</description>

      <description>I have experienced a few explosions here and there. Yes, it’s me not reading the docs. But it’s also me, assuming that verbs mean one thing and not another. Let’s do some unique operations in different languages.
The MATLAB way &amp;gt;&amp;gt; unique([3, 3, 3, 90, 10]) ans = 3 10 90  The Python way &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import numpy as np &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; np.unique([3, 3, 3, 90, 10]) array([ 3, 10, 90])  The R way unique(c(3,3,3, 90, 10)) ## [1] 3 90 10 This is what I would expect.</description>

      <title>Birthday Problem</title>

      <description>We have all been there, classic math riddle:
 How many people need to be in one room so that the probability of two of them having the same birthday is more than 0.5?
 In a recent bootcamp exercise we tackled this in python and I wanted to share, just because it’s fun. I did it for a range of probabilities. My solution is probably not the fastest/shortest/most pythonic, but it’s a little thing I put out there so, if you want to use/improve it, please do!</description>

      <title>Python Keylogger</title>

      <description>I have been struggling a lot with pain in my fingers and wrists. I have tried setting up timers for using the keyboard. But the only thing that seems to work is reducing the typing (aka get away from the computer and stop using the keyboard!).
Tracking hours didn’t work well, so I guess a last resort to force me is counting the actual number of keys per day and trying to keep that to a minimum.</description>

      <description>People say that if you have to explain a joke, it loses value. Probably true. I guess I just wanted to partially comment on how different disciplines analyze different levels of complexity.
As molecular biologist, I think we were trained to seldom think about the whole system, we were trained to just give up complexity and focus on a couple of fancy names (yes, YFG fits pretty well as the center of this Universe).</description>

      <description>Paying attention to the small details sounds like a waste of time. Where&amp;rsquo;s that 80&amp;frasl;20 rule when I need it? Well, yes, talking about a small increment sounds boring and useless. A 1% increase in performance might seem trivial. Unexciting. A rounding error.
But it is often neglected because we don&amp;rsquo;t have a good dimension of scales (e.g., A small percent of a lot of money it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of money) or even when we do, we fail to grasp what exponential phenomena look like.</description>

      <description>Lo bueno, si breve, dos veces bueno.
 Me tomo la libertad de este juego literario1 para introducir un ensayo con algunas pautas interesantes para escribir. En pocas palabras, Paul Graham nos regala una lista de acciones que es conveniente tomar para producir escritos de calidad.
La siguiente es una traduccion del ensayo “Writing, Briefly” escrito por Paul Graham2.
Escribir, en pocas palabras (En el proceso de responder un email, accidentalmente escribí un pequeño ensayo sobre cómo escribir.</description>

      <description>I spent a good portion of the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 reading Paul Graham’s essays. Many caught my attention (and my fingers to take notes). I want to comment on an essay about advice for good writing. Because it was written in a way that allowed for easy reformatting (ideas separated by ;, I thought it would be cool to convert the prose into a checklist).</description>

      <description>It’s been a bit more than a year since I got a fitbit and I have been pretty excited about tracking my activity and heart rate. I should say I’m quite surprised about the sleep data. Tracking sleep has been, in fact, the most exciting feature, and I now strive to get at least 7 hours of sleep per night.

      <description>I have been thinking about different problems I have when writing code and the things that I normally try to do to keep my projects clean and functional. I wrote this post to put this thoughts out there, hopefully I will receive input from the great software engineers out there.
