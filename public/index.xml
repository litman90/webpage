      <description>There are many managers I admire, some of whom I was lucky personally meet, others I &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; through reading their books/blogs.
I have have borrowed different questions and suggestions I liked from these managers to create an Icebreaker, a set of questions that can quickly provide me information about a new person I&amp;rsquo;m working with. At the same time, I wrote this post to provide new people in our team with basic knowledge about me, the new person they are working with.</description>

      <title>Queen&#39;s Gambit</title>

      <description>I love games. I enjoy the fun in many formats: cards, boards, consoles. Yet, over the years, chess has consolidated as the game I play most often, and it is likely the only game I both really like and can limit the amount I play1.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of months since I noticed something weird going on in my games, a sort of disturbance in the force. I felt I was playing a type of position called Queen&amp;rsquo;s Gambit way more often than normal.</description>

      <description>I have not made new year resolutions, I made art. I also finally got some time to explore one of the little Shiny projects that were dormant in my /Project folder during most of 2020: lifeviz.
The goal of lifeviz is to visualize life events. This has been inspired by the post ‘The Tail End’ by WaitButWhy. I have taken the visualizations and added a few degrees of freedom, so that the users can visualize the past/present.</description>

      <title>Rotating perspectives</title>

      <description>I have been asked to unveil a bit of what&amp;rsquo;s under the hood on this post. I decided to make a new post to share how my creative process took place and maybe inspire others to play along.
Something interesting about all of this is how well it plays into common sense. Looking at things from a different perspective, in this case adding just a rotation, can yield outstanding results.</description>

      <description>I have not made resolutions for this year1. I have instead spent that time playing with patterns on a canvas. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wanted to have some time to do generative art using geometric figures and I finally got down to it on the very first day of this year. I found a fountain of joy after just a few hours of tinkering, something inside tells me this could be a new New Year&amp;rsquo;s tradition for me.</description>

      <description>There are many traders and most of them blow up at some point in their careers1. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why we worship those who don&amp;rsquo;t. We find rational explanations for their success, which basically boil down to saying they are smarter/faster/bolder/better than everyone else. We may even go as far as justifying success at all costs.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of skill involved in playing dice with such great results over such a long period of time.</description>

      <description>I have experienced a few explosions here and there. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s me not reading the docs. But it&amp;rsquo;s also me, assuming that verbs mean one thing and not another. Let&amp;rsquo;s do some unique operations in different languages.
The MATLAB way &amp;gt;&amp;gt; unique([3, 3, 3, 90, 10]) ans = 3 10 90  The Python way &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import numpy as np &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; np.unique([3, 3, 3, 90, 10]) array([ 3, 10, 90])  The R way unique(c(3,3,3, 90, 10))  ## [1] 3 90 10  This is what I would expect.</description>

      <title>Birthday Problem</title>

      <description>We have all been there, classic math riddle:
 How many people need to be in one room so that the probability of two of them having the same birthday is more than 0.5?
 In a recent bootcamp exercise we tackled this in python and I wanted to share, just because it&amp;rsquo;s fun. I did it for a range of probabilities. My solution is probably not the fastest/shortest/most pythonic, but it&amp;rsquo;s a little thing I put out there so, if you want to use/improve it, please do!</description>

      <title>Python Keylogger</title>

      <description>I have been struggling a lot with pain in my fingers and wrists. I have tried setting up timers for using the keyboard. But the only thing that seems to work is reducing the typing (aka get away from the computer and stop using the keyboard!).
Tracking hours didn&amp;rsquo;t work well, so I guess a last resort to force me is counting the actual number of keys per day and trying to keep that to a minimum.</description>

      <description>People say that if you have to explain a joke, it loses value. Probably true. I guess I just wanted to partially comment on how different disciplines analyze different levels of complexity.
As molecular biologist, I think we were trained to seldom think about the whole system, we were trained to just give up complexity and focus on a couple of fancy names (yes, YFG fits pretty well as the center of this Universe).</description>
